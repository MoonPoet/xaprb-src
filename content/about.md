I am the founder of [VividCortex](https://www.vividcortex.com/) and the lead author of [High Performance MySQL](http://www.highperfmysql.com/). I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia, then worked at several technology companies. I spent the first decade of my career as a programmer, and created a lot of open-source software. My online nickname Xaprb is my first name Baron typed in QWERTY on a Dvorak keyboard layout.

High-resolution headshots for press, media, conference pages, etc are here: [1](/baron.jpg), [2](/baron-2.jpg).

This blog is my personal writing and I do not use copywriting services or guest
posts, nor do I do any type of joint marketing. I use affiliate links to offset
the costs of hosting and other services.

You can contact me using my first name at VividCortex. You can also find me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/xaprb), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xaprb),
[Keybase](https://keybase.io/xaprb), and [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/).

I'm private about my personal life, but I try to be an open book about who I am.
I wrote this page to help you learn what makes me tick.

### My Personality and Behaviors

Personality assessments are a useful tool for describing my style.
Using the DISC model of personality, I'm a DC.  When plotted in a DISC wheel,
I'm a Conducting Implementor.

![DISC](/media/disc-wheel.png)

In plain English, my strongest behaviors are:

- I'm direct, to-the-point, and can be blunt; I'm not very diplomatic.
- I'm independent, assertive, demanding, and comfortable with risk.
- I'm ambitious, determined, persistent, and competitive; I love winning and dislike losing.
- I'm objective, logical, analytical, technical, and data-driven.
- I'm understated and guarded, and prefer to observe rather than
  being the center of attention.
- I'm task-focused, results-focused, fast-moving, and urgent.
- I'm skeptical, perfectionist, and detail-oriented. I find typos.
- I value clear and concise communication. I dislike fluff and ambiguity.
- I'm creative, visionary, futuristic, and forward-looking.
- I value my time highly and manage it carefully.
- I take responsibilities seriously and expect others to do the same.
- I'm mostly reserved and introverted. I like hugs, but I don't initiate hugging
  except with family and close friends. I seldom project emotion and can appear aloof.
- You won't think I am much fun till you know me well, but I have a slapstick
  sense of humor.
- I'm focused, steady, calm, patient, and agreeable.

People usually experience me as supportive, attentive, active, engaged,
decisive, and motivating. You might find my passion and drive compelling.  When
I'm under stress, you might feel that I'm abrasive and controlling. At my worst,
I can be a pushy perfectionist, and you might feel that I demand too much too
fast.

### My Driving Forces

The next layer of the onion is my inner motivations---what I value and
what drives my decisions and behaviors. Here are my scores on Eduard Spranger's
model of hidden motivators:

![Driving Forces](/media/driving-forces.png)

Here's an interpretation of that chart in my own words, keyed off the name shown
above the centerline of each spectrum:

- **Knowledge**: I am highly theoretical, driven to research, understand, and
  discover truth. I'm insatiably curious. I am skeptical of intuition and rarely
  rely on gut feeling alone. If I visit your house, I'll look at the titles on
  your bookshelf before I look at the family photos on your wall.
- **Utility**: I do things with an outcome in mind, rather than for the greater
  good, the cause, or the sake of doing. Money is rarely my motivator; I care
  more about impact and results.  I look for group wins as well as individual
  contributions.
- **Surroundings**: I'm a detail-oriented big-picture thinker. I value great
  design, simplicity, and function over form. I see the trees before the forest,
  and I might emphasize one or the other situationally. I love music, art, and
  poetry, but I don't always take the time to create beauty in my surroundings.
  I function well in chaos, and I think conflict is productive, but I will try
  to create order. I value quality craftsmanship, but I'm happy with a good
  bargain. I embrace Wabi-sabi. I don't emphasize my appearance, and tend to dress simply.
- **Others**: I recognize and value people's individuality, but I generally help
  people for a specific purpose, rather than for the satisfaction of being
  supportive. I believe everyone should contribute to the best of their ability.
  Because of my substantial Selfless and Harmonious motivations, I don't think
  it's a win if anyone is left out, and I'll champion those who need protection.
- **Power**: In most situations I am comfortable taking charge, especially when
  I see that it's needed. I don't need public recognition, and I direct for the
  sake of achieving results, rather than for power, political reasons, or
  self-esteem.
- **Methodologies**: I interpret traditions flexibly and I don't feel bound by
  the way things have always been done. I do not need external guidance or
  organizational structure to give me direction or standards; I set my own. I
  seek input from others, but I form opinions independently. I'll check if a
  process exists before I invent a new one. I have an ever-changing system for
  living and I think outside the box to find the best way to approach each
  individual situation. I live by the motto "strong opinions loosely held."

The only dimension where I'm outside the norm is Intentional. Thus, you are
unlikely to find me too extreme in my views, but if you are extremely
Altruistic, you might feel I'm not caring enough. I do care, but as a CEO I have
to balance my caring with a business focus.

### Gallup StrengthsFinder

People frequently mention the StrengthsFinder report to me, implying that many
people are familiar with it and it could be helpful to include here. My top five
themes are:

1. Achiever
2. Restorative
3. Learner
4. Responsibility
5. Adaptability

### Advice For Communicating With Me

Here are some things to keep in mind when approaching me.

- Be clear, brief, and concise.
- Begin with your conclusions or recommendations (don't begin with facts and
  build to conclusions). Be prepared to support and explain your reasoning and
  data, but let me ask for the details if I want them.
- Don't leave things open-ended, ramble, or make non-specific requests. Have a
  clear "ask," and clear next steps and action items to achieve a specific
  outcome.
- Don't forget things or rely on me to set the agenda. Always follow up and
  follow through. Send spell-checked materials in advance.
- Don't try to pressure or dominate me. Don't expect people's opinions of me to
  influence me.
- Don't exaggerate, speculate, or make statements you can't prove.
- Avoid melodrama, appealing to my self-interests, or anything that could feel
  manipulative, such as quid-pro-quo, flattery, name-dropping, or buzzwords.
- Don't touch me or get too close to me.
- Stick to business instead of talking about my weekend plans or my family,
  unless we're close friends or I signal that I'm in a mood to engage socially.
- It's OK to be critical, but I appreciate if you can suggest solutions too.
  Also, I don't mind if you criticize me, but it really bothers me if you
  criticize people I care about.
- I'm a little allergic to people who try to guess at things beyond face value,
  such as thinking they have insight into other people's motives in complicated
  circumstances.

Specific advice that's relevant to particular circumstances:

- I've lost some high-frequency hearing, especially in my left ear. In noisy
  environments like restaurants, it's really hard for me to hear what people are
  saying. If you tilt your face up towards me a bit, it helps a lot.
- Use email, text, or phone. Don't use LinkedIn messaging, Twitter DMs, Facebook
  messages, Slack, or any other isolated systems. I may never notice your
  message; I simply don't check 99 places for messages. For secure messaging you
  can use Signal or GPG-secured email.
- I only have notifications enabled for phone calls and text messages. I'll get
  to everything else (as long as it's email, that is) in due course.
- If you repeatedly call me and don't leave voicemail I'll block your number.
- If you spam non-individual emails at my company you'll get permanently blocked
  at the domain level.

### How To Understand My Unique Perspectives

In my experience with hundreds of personality assessments, few people (perhaps 1 in 20) fall in the top center of the DISC wheel where I am, so you
might not interact with people similar to me very often.  As such, I might
behave in surprising or seemingly contradictory ways, or send mixed signals.

There's usually a logic behind it, and I'm rarely arbitrary or haphazard. Here's how to interpret and work with some of my characteristics you might experience as odd or unexpected:

- **Supportive but unemotional.** I'm basically introverted.  I value actions
  more highly than words or body language, so I'm often undemonstrative and you
  might feel that I am situationally empathetic at best, even if you're part of
  my inner circle of close associates. In truth, I care deeply for people.  I'm
  fiercely loyal and supportive, and I'll fight hard for people after I reach a
  certain level of trust with them.
- **Audacious but cautious.** Given time, I prefer to be data-driven, but I
  sometimes make quick judgments without explaining all of the reasoning. This
  can seem rash, but I'm usually pursuing a specific goal, such as optimizing
  for learning or trying to eliminate dead ends quickly. My boldness isn't
  reckless.  I want everyone who works with me to be biased to action, avoiding
  analysis paralysis.  I like the phrase "a fast B grade is better than a slow
  A," or perhaps better yet "done is better than perfect, so if it's worth
  doing, it's worth doing badly." A lot of my worldview is included in that
  counterintuitive phrase, which I like to think has a lot of value beneath the
  surface.
- **Intelligent but not eloquent.** When I'm trying to collect more data and
  express myself at the same time, I sometimes stumble over my words. This can
  make me seem hesitant or uncertain, especially when I'm speaking without
  preparation or trying to understand someone's point of view. I appreciate you
  helping me with prompts, echoing back in your own words what you think I'm
  trying to say, or simply being patient with me. 
- **Visionary but visionary.** I sometimes describe the future without laying
  out a specific path to achieve it. I may jump around mentally and verbally,
  leaving thoughts unfinished in my excitement. I may not be aware when you
  don't see my vision clearly, or aren't clear on the steps to reach it.  It's a
  good idea to make sure I know if this is the case. Ask me to connect the dots
  for you.
- **Easy-going but determined.** According to the personality assessment, my
  "quiet demeanor conceals deeply held convictions," and I find that very
  accurate. In practice, it means that you might misinterpret my agreeable
  manner as submissiveness or lack of opinion, especially if you are a high DI
  (you fall in the Conductor or Persuader quadrants of the DISC wheel). When I
  feel that people don't take me seriously unless I'm raising my voice, or that
  they feel they have the upper hand by force of personality alone, I feel
  disrespected, and that can lead to clashes. It's something to be aware of, for
  me and you both.
- **Demanding but methodical.** Because I move fast and challenge people, you
  might wonder if I give people enough chances. I might not tell you the private
  details, but my decisions about others aren't arbitrary, and I practice
  no-surprises leadership. If I'm unsatisfied with your work, I'll tell you
  directly, and I'm very open about it. But because I don't look for external
  validation, I don't naturally think to give overtly positive feedback to
  others. I'd like to improve at that, so please prompt me if you feel
  comfortable doing so.
- **Detailed but minimalist.** Because I am data-driven and perfectionist, I
  strive for simplicity so I can keep my mind clear and undistracted. I like
  systems to be explained and governed by elegant, predictable models and rules.
  I will challenge complicated spreadsheets, algorithms, or agreements and ask
  if they can be simpler and clearer.
- **Open-minded but independent.** I don't really value other people's opinions
  or judgments of me, but I value the information they can give me, so I'm
  happy---even eager---to get outside perspectives and observations. I learn the
  most from people who disagree with me.  I suspend my beliefs, ask questions to
  draw out their views, take what I like and leave the rest, and even play
  devil's advocate against myself.  This can disturb some people, because it
  looks like I am rudderless and lack self-confidence.  It's true that I move
  the rudder freely, because it is not the rudder that guides me; it is my
  personal North Star. And it is self-acceptance, not self-confidence, that
  enables me to release doubts and act swiftly.

Please feel free to give me feedback that will help me learn more about myself!
It's OK to be very direct about this; you won't hurt my feelings. (See above.)
