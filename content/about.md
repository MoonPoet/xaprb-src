[![Baron Schwartz](/baron-square.jpg# fl maxw-30pct mr-4)](/baron.jpg)

I am Baron Schwartz, formerly founder of VividCortex and lead author of [High Performance MySQL](http://www.highperfmysql.com/). I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia, then worked at several technology companies. I spent the first decade of my career as a programmer, and created a lot of open-source software. My current focus is on justice and peace in myself and the world.

High-resolution headshots are here: [1](/baron.jpg), [2](/baron-2.jpg), [3](/baron-3.jpg).

This blog is my personal writing and I do not use copywriting services or guest
posts, nor do I do any type of joint marketing.

I'm private about my personal life, but I try to be an open book about who I am.
Using the DISC model of personality, I'm a DC.  When plotted in a DISC wheel,
I'm a Conducting Implementor.

The next layer of the onion is my inner motivations:

People usually experience me as supportive, attentive, active, engaged,
decisive, and motivating. You might find my passion and drive compelling.  When
I'm stressed, you might feel that I'm blunt, abrasive, and controlling. At my worst,
I can be a pushy perfectionist, and you might feel that I demand too much too
fast. I'm driven by intentionality, knowledge, curiosity,
results, group wins, big-picture thinking, simplicity, function, utilitarianism,
purposefulness, selflessness/altruism, constantly evolving my system for living.
