I am the founder of [VividCortex](https://www.vividcortex.com/) and the lead author of [High Performance MySQL](http://www.highperfmysql.com/). I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia, then worked at several technology companies. I used to be a programmer and created a lot of open-source software. My online nickname Xaprb is my first name typed in QWERTY on a Dvorak keyboard layout.

You can contact me using my first name at VividCortex. You can also find me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/xaprb), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xaprb),
[Keybase](https://keybase.io/xaprb), and [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/).

I'm private about my personal life, but I try to be an open book about who I am
and what I believe. I wrote this page to help you learn what's beneath the
surface.

### My Personality and Behaviors

Personality assessments are a useful tool for describing my style.
Using the DISC model of personality, I'm a DC.  When plotted in a DISC wheel,
I'm a Conducting Implementor.

In plain English, my strongest behaviors are:

- I'm focused, steady, calm, patient, and agreeable.
- I'm task-focused, results-focused, fast-moving, and urgent.
- I value my time highly and manage it carefully.
- I take responsibilities seriously and expect others to do the same.
- I'm independent, assertive, demanding, and comfortable with risk.
- I'm ambitious, determined, persistent, and competitive; I love winning and dislike losing.
- My communication style is direct, to-the-point, and can be blunt.
- I'm skeptical, perfectionist, and detail-oriented. I find typos.
- I value clear and concise communication. I dislike fluff and ambiguity.
- I'm creative, visionary, futuristic, and forward-looking.
- I'm objective, logical, analytical, technical, and data-driven.
- I'm reserved and introverted. I'm not a hugger except with family and close
  friends. I don't project emotion and can seem cold, uncaring, or aloof.
- I'm understated and guarded, and prefer to observe rather than
  being the center of attention.
- I have a zany sense of humor and I love to laugh at myself.

People usually experience me as supportive, attentive, active, engaged,
decisive, and motivating. You might find my passion and drive to be infectious.
When I'm under stress, you might feel that I'm abrasive and controlling. At my
worst, I can be a pushy perfectionist, and you might feel that I demand too much
too fast.

### My Driving Forces

The next layer of the onion is my inner motivations---what I value and
what drives my decisions and behaviors. Here are my scores on Eduard Spranger's
model of hidden motivators:

![Driving Forces](/media/driving-forces.png)

Here's an interpretation of that chart in my own words, keyed off the name shown
above the centerline of each spectrum:

- **Knowledge**: I am highly theoretical, driven to research, understand, and
  discover truth. I am skeptical of intuition and rarely rely on gut feeling
  alone.
- **Utility**: I do things with an outcome in mind, rather than for
  the greater good, the cause, or the sake of doing. Money is rarely my
  motivator; I care more about impact and results.  I reward group
  wins as well as individual contributions.
- **Surroundings**: I value function over form, great design, and simplicity. I
  see the trees before the forest, but depending on the situation I might
  emphasize one or the other. I love music, art, and poetry, but I don't always
  take the time to create beauty in my surroundings. I am comfortable in chaos,
  but I work to improve it. I value quality craftsmanship, but I'm happy with a
  good bargain.
- **Others**: I recognize and value people's individuality, but I generally help
  people for a specific purpose, rather than for the satisfaction of being
  supportive. I believe everyone should contribute to the best of their ability.
  Because of my significant Selfless and Harmonious motivations, I don't think
  it's a win if anyone is left out, and I'll champion those who need protection.
- **Power**: In most situations I am comfortable taking charge, especially when
  I see that it's needed. I don't need public recognition, and I direct for the
  sake of achieving results, rather than for power, political reasons, or
  self-esteem.
- **Methodologies**: I interpret traditions flexibly and I don't feel bound by
  the way things have always been done. I do not need external guidance or
  organizational structure to give me direction or standards; I set my own. I'll
  check if a process exists before I invent a new one. I have an ever-changing
  system for living and I think outside the box to find the best way to approach
  each individual situation. I live by the motto "strong opinions loosely held."

Of these dimensions, the only one where I'm outside the norm is Intentional. You
are unlikely to find me too extreme in my views, unless you are extremely
Altruistic, in which case we might get impatient with each other!

### Advice For Communicating With Me

Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind when approaching me.

- Be clear, brief, and concise.
- Begin with your conclusions or recommendations. Be prepared to support and
  explain your reasoning and data, but let me ask for the details if I want
  them.
- Don't leave things open-ended, ramble, or make non-specific requests. Have a
  clear "ask," and clear next steps and action items to achieve a specific
  outcome.
- Don't forget things or rely on me to set the agenda. Always follow up and
  follow through.
- Don't exaggerate, speculate, or make statements you can't prove.
- Avoid melodrama, appealing to my self-interests, or anything that could feel
  manipulative, such as quid-pro-quo, flattery, name-dropping, or buzzwords.
- Don't touch me or get too close to me.
- Stick to business instead of talking about my weekend plans or my family,
  unless we're close friends or I signal that I'm in a mood to engage socially.

### How To Understand My Unique Perspectives

Most people don't fall in the top center of the DISC wheel where I am, so you
probably don't interact with people similar to me very often.  As such, I might
behave in surprising or seemingly contradictory ways.  There's always a logic
behind it, and I'm not arbitrary or haphazard.

Here's how to interpret and work with some of the atypical things you
might experience about me:

- **Supportive but unemotional.** I'm basically introverted with a small inner
  circle. I value actions more highly than words or body language, so I'm often
  undemonstrative and you might feel that I am situationally empathetic at best.
  In truth, I care deeply for people. I'm fiercely loyal and supportive, and
  I'll stand up and fight for you.
- **Audacious but cautious.** Given time, I prefer to be data-driven, but I
  sometimes make quick judgments without explaining all of the reasoning. This
  might seem rash, but it's the opposite: I'm optimizing for learning and trying
  to eliminate dead ends quickly. My boldness isn't reckless.
- **Intelligent but not eloquent.** When I'm trying to collect more data and
  express myself at the same time, I stumble over my words. This can make me
  seem hesitant or uncertain, especially when I'm speaking without preparation
  or trying to understand someone's point of view. I appreciate you helping me
  with prompts, echoing back in your own words what you think I'm trying to say,
  or simply being patient with me. 
- **Visionary but disjointed.** I sometimes describe the future without laying
  out a specific path to achieve it. I may not be aware when you don't see my
  vision clearly, or aren't clear on the steps to reach it.  It's a good idea to
  make sure I know if this is the case.
- **Easy-going but determined.** My quiet demeanor conceals deeply held
  convictions. Because I'm motivated by purpose and not ego, I'm like a jazz
  musician: I listen and play the notes that are lacking, then create space for
  other people to participate.  You might misinterpret my agreeable manner as
  submissiveness or lack of opinion, *especially if you fall in the Conductor or
  Persuader quadrants of the DISC wheel*.  But I'm the CEO, there's only one,
  and the company is not a democracy or a committee.
- **Demanding but methodical.** Because I move fast and challenge people, you
  might wonder if I give people enough chances. I might not tell you the private
  details about decisions involving others, but my actions aren't arbitrary, and
  I practice no-surprises leadership. If I'm unsatisfied with your work, I'll
  tell you directly, but because I don't look for external validation, I don't
  naturally think to give it to others. I'd like to improve at that, so please
  prompt me if you feel comfortable doing so.
- **Open-minded but independent.** I learn the most from people who disagree
  with me.  I suspend my beliefs, ask questions to draw out their views, take
  what I like and leave the rest, and even play devil's advocate against myself.
  This can disturb some people, because it looks like I am rudderless and lack
  self-confidence.  It's true that I move the rudder freely, because it is not
  the rudder that guides me; it is the North Star. And it is self-acceptance,
  not self-confidence, that enables me to let go of doubt and act.

Please feel free to give me feedback that will help me learn more about myself!
