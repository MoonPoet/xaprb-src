Two of my proposals for [Percona Live London on October 24-25](http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/?discount=come-c-talk) have been approved! Yes, I really had to propose them and get them approved like everyone else, although as I'm sure you can imagine, I had a good chance at being accepted :-) Not all of my talks were accepted, though.

I'll be presenting [a half-day tutorial](http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/tutorial/expert-troubleshooting/?discount=come-c-talk) on how to get great results when troubleshooting MySQL problems, and a [conference session](http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/session/measuring-scalability-and-performance-with-tcp/?discount=come-c-talk) on how to use TCP packet headers to measure and analyze a surprising variety of aspects of MySQL performance and scalability.

The [early-bird pricing discount](http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/?discount=come-c-talk) has been extended until the 28th! And the links in this blog post will enable a special discount code at registration to shave another 40 pounds off the ticket price.
