Keith Larson (Oracle's MySQL Community Manager) [nominated me to become an Oracle ACE](http://sqlhjalp.blogspot.com/2011/07/oracle-ace-award-baron-schwartz.html). Thank you Oracle -- it feels very good to receive this [award](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=19297:4:4267673706864143::NO:4:P4_ID:4342).
