I'll be speaking at [IOUG's Collaborate](http://www.collaborate11.org/) conference in Florida the week of April 10-14. My session is called [MySQL Performance Basics](http://coll11.mapyourshow.com/3_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=2100). For those who know MySQL, this won't be exciting, but if you're new to it, I hope it will be a good orientation to what you should focus on and ignore.

Sheeri Cabral posted a good round-up of [the MySQL talks at Collaborate](http://palominodb.com/blog/2011/03/09/mysql-beginners-guide-collaborate) on the PalominoDB blog.
