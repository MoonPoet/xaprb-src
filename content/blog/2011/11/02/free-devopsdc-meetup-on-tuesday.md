Next Tuesday I'll be speaking at the [DevOpsDC meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/events/33510782/) at [CustomInk's](http://www.customink.com/) offices. I'll talk about why MySQL downtime happens and what you can do to avoid or prevent it. This is a research-based talk (but it's not scientific... they're different) that draws on hundreds of downtime issues I've studied. The related [white papers are available on Percona's website](http://www.percona.com/about-us/mysql-white-papers/). Hope to see you there!
