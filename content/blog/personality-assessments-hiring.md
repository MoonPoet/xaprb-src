I've been using personality assessments as part of recruiting and hiring for
several years now. Although most people aren't familiar with these assessments
when they enter our recruiting process, the experience is uniformly positive for
them, and they almost always comment how interesting it was and thank us for
doing this with them. It's been a valuable exercise that has helped
me get better results and develop my judgment about people.

The assessments are never really correct, so a vital step is
reviewing the report with the candidate. This is another unusual part of the
process I've designed together with my CEO coach. Other companies that use
assessments tend to simply use them to eliminate candidates, and never share the
results with the candidates. I think this is a pity; most of the value I find is
in the conversation, not the assessment itself. How the candidate reacts to the
report; which things they think are true or false and why; which things they
engage with and which they skip over; those are all revealing.[^post]

The assessment is a bit like a coffee-table book.  It's there to generate a
really interesting and deep conversation about how candidates view themselves.
The assessments themselves give us a common terminology to understand and
describe what they measure. These are usually vague concepts until we use an
assessment to make them crisp. It's about self-awareness and ensuring that we're
using words that mean what we think they mean.

People who haven't used assessments in hiring often disparage them.  An example
that comes to mind is a senior sales leader I was working with
on a consulting basis. When I say "senior," I mean this person was old enough to
be my grandfather, and had been doing sales since he was a boy. "Those
assessments are fine, Baron, but they don't tell the whole story and they're
sometimes wrong," he said. (No arguments there.) "I've been doing this my whole
life, and these assessments would eliminate a lot of the best sales people I've
ever hired." (Probably also true; that's why I don't take them at face
value.)

We were going through resumes and he was excited about one candidate,
we'll call him John. John's assessments showed no signs of sales-related
motivations. He was a theoretical person who was pretty much the opposite
of a salesperson. His resume showed the same thing: his college degree and
passion projects were analytical, solitary, and philosophical. He didn't really
have sales experience, either. His previous role had sort of been sales-related,
but he'd really just been facilitating people who'd already decided to buy,
which was much different than the job we were considering him for. And all
four of his assessments (we use a battery of them, not just one) spoke with a
single voice, giving me little reason to believe he'd gamed the assessment or
that there was anything that didn't meet the eye.

"I don't think John wants to sell," I told the consultant. "I think he wants to
build a tiny cabin in the remote woods and write the next great American novel."
The sales consultant pooh-poohed that. "He's got *fire* in his belly. I'm
telling you, John is a meat-eating bloodthirsty salesperson, he's just early in
his career." We brought John in and reviewed the assessment with him. He agreed
with everything in the report, marveling at its accuracy. A few days later he
called to withdraw from the process, saying that reviewing the assessment report
had helped him to realize sales wasn't for him, and that he was reprioritizing
his life to ensure that he could achieve his dream: writing.

I could tell many similar anecdotes about the assessments. Another one, quickly:
I was recruiting for a leadership position and a person who wanted to "be" a
leader[^be] applied. His assessments were deeply conflicting with each other:
the first and simplest one screamed "leader" to extremes, making me suspect he'd
tried to get the assessment to score him as a leader. (That one is pretty easy
to game.) The other assessments, which are much more confusing when you fill
them out, told the opposite story. When he reviewed the report with me, he was
unable to reconcile all the different things the assessment was
saying about him, distressed at the idea that he'd behave or think in the ways
the report said. It was obvious that he wasn't that person and he had to be true
to himself.  So I asked him and he said yes, he'd tried to get the "right
answer." Some things can be learned and some things are skills; and some things
are innate. If I'd hired him into the leadership position, he'd have been
catastrophically miserable, and he'd have failed at the job. It's important to
know who you really are!

These experiences have helped me form a mental model about how people behave,
what motivates them, how they value things, and what they're skilled at. Now I
can often have a conversation with someone, *without* an assessment, and quickly
understand questions like: is this person more direct or cautious? Is this
person more motivated to be selfish or selfless? Do they make decisions
logically or intuitively? How will they behave under pressure? Are they
fast-paced? Do they create or resist change?

This outcome---improved people skills---is *far* more valuable to me as a leader
than using assessments for filtering a candidate in or out of a recruiting
process.

If you're skeptical about assessments, consider this: do you interview people to
determine their experiences? And do you hire them for their skills and
abilities?  Most people work hard at these things, so you probably answered
yes to these questions.

Now: why do you *fire* people? Usually for their behaviors and sometimes for
their motivations, right? When you think about someone who was a "bad
culture fit," are you mostly talking about behaviors and motivations?

Do you have a repeatable, objective, unbiased way to understand the behaviors
and motivations of candidates during the interview process?

Most people don't. And that's part of why they hire people with the right
skills, experiences, and abilities---and end up being forced to fire them
because of their behaviors or lack of motivation.

Assessments, and *especially* the practice of reviewing the assessment report
with the candidate, can be an effective way to help break the vicious cycle of
hiring for one set of qualities and firing for another. If you haven't used
assessments, or if you have a dim view of them, give it some more thought. It
can be a powerful tool in your kit. And it can help you grow as a leader.

[^post]: I also use assessments for many other purposes post-hiring, but that's a topic for another blog post.
[^be]: Moral: never get enamored with the title or name of the role. Always think about whether you want to *do* the activities of the role. Confusing the two is a recipe for failure and unhappiness.
