tldr: "While listening to a podcast, I was struck by how I'm a different person when I'm interacting with the host, even just listening to the show. I don't believe that I'm separate from other people. They're part of me, and that's as it should be."

I was driving home from a board meeting the other day catching up on podcasts.
I have a short commute, so I always get way behind on podcasts and only catch up when I have to travel afar.
I was listening to one hosted by someone I know, and I suddenly realized that when we're together I'm different.
(This isn't going where it might sound like it is.)

The other day I wrote about [love](/blog/something-that-we-do), and mentioned that I remembered a phrase from [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]({{< amz 0743269519 >}}).
Another memory from that book flitted through my mind, something about the danger of defining yourself in terms of who you're with at the moment.
It might go something like, "you can stop being a different person depending on who you're with, and life stops being like a fun-house mirror."^[I need to find my copy of the book and read it again; I'm probably missing the whole point here.]

But I don't believe that I'm separate from other people.
I'm not an independent, isolated "me."
Self is an illusion.
I am "we."

I am we, who are together in the moment.
I am we, who have interacted in the past.

Some of the thoughts and feelings that you had, transferred to me.
You changed my neurons and memories, and I'm not the same, and never will be.
Then we saw each other's tweets and the process continued.
Or I listened to your podcast and became even more of you.
Even at a physical and chemical level this is true.
When we were in the room together, we breathed the same air, and now some of the molecules of our bodies are still in each other.
This isn't poetry or philosophy, it's science, as Thich Nhat Hanh says.

So yes, when I'm together with so-and-so, I'm a different person.
Every interaction we have shapes us and leaves us different.
We're connected, inter-being, interdependent.^[Covey writes a lot about interdependence, which is part of why I think my fleeting memory might be inaccurate.]

I am we.
And that's as it should be.
