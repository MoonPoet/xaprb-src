Mindfulness meditation has changed me perhaps more than any other influence in
my life. Here are four books whose wisdom I treasure.

### Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]({{< amz 1590308492 >}}) by Shunryu Suzuki is a collection of informal talks on mindfulness meditation as given to his students. Arranged into three sections, each lecture is from one to several pages long. The voice of Suzuki Roshi springs off the page, lively, humorous, gentle. Reading this book feels like having a conversation with a very good friend who gently explains, in immensely lucid terms, how simple the solution to every problem is and how to practice.

### Wherever You Go, There You Are

[Wherever You Go, There You Are]({{< amz 1401307787 >}})
by Jon Kabat-Zinn is my second favorite book, and similarly to Suzuki's, it
plainly states that meditation is nothing complicated or special: it's simply
about being in the current moment, observing. Like Zen Mind, too, it is broken
into many small thoughts that are a quick read, making it ideal to keep in a
place where you can pick it up when you have 90 seconds and bring a little more
awareness to the moment. And like Zen Mind, it gives eminently practical advice
about the *how*.

### Walden

[Walden]({{< amz 1546561129 >}}), by
Henry David Thoreau, is the American classic on what it means to be alive.
Although not really a book about mindfulness, it is nonetheless woven through
with Henry David's delightful experiences with mindfulness as he simply "enjoyed
the bloom of the present moment." I linked to Amazon, but if you can, go to a
good used or antique bookstore and see if they have an old edition of it. By
doing so, you might be able to find a printing that you can appreciate for the
craft, which can give an extra dimension to the experience of reading it.

### Tao-Te-Ching

[Tao-Te-Ching]({{< amz 0061142662 >}}), by
Lao-Tzu and in a new translation by Stephen Mitchell, is a gift to humankind as significant
as the Sermon on the Mount. Again, not strictly about mindfulness or
how to practice, but the short chapters are as rich as any Zen koan. The
translation is crucial: other translations I've read have done little for me,
but if I had to choose one book to have on a desert island, this would certainly
make the short list. This comes in a miniature edition that I have carried all
over the world with me for years.

### Bonus: Get Some Headspace

[Get Some
Headspace]({{< amz B00DO8Q33I >}}),
by Andy Puddicombe, is the book that actually started my practice of mindfulness
meditation as it is today. The [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) website
and mobile app also helped me establish my practice.

There are thousands of other books on meditation and mindfulness, many of them
written by people who are perhaps studying mediation but not practicing it. I
have read dozens of them. Many are good, but in my view, the above are the best.

If I were to buy only one, I'd start with Jon Kabat-Zinn's. If I simply wanted
to establish a mindfulness meditation practice, I'd start with the Headspace app
or website, and then read Suzuki or Kabat-Zinn after a little while.

Above all: the advice I'd give myself is to simply practice.
