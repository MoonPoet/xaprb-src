title: "The Erlang Response Time Stretch Factor For 3 And 4 Servers"
---

In a [previous post](/blog/response-time-stretch-factor/) I explored a few
variations of equations that express the M/M/m queueing theory response time
"stretch factor," and tried to indicate some areas where I wanted to dig into
the relationships between these formulas a bit more. In this post I discuss the
divergence between the official Erlang C formula and Neil Gunther's heuristic
approximation to it. I introduced this before thusly:

Here's the Erlang form again:

$$
R(m, \\rho) = 1 + \\frac{ \\frac{(m \\rho)^m}{m!} }{ (1-\\rho) \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \\frac{(m \\rho)^n}{n!} + \\frac{(m \\rho)^m}{m!} } \\frac{1}{m(1-\\rho)}
$$

And the equivalent heuristic by Gunther, which is exact for 1 and 2 service
channels:

$$
R(m, \\rho) \\approx \\frac{1}{1-\\rho^m}
$$

Note that this is a stretch factor relative to the service time, i.e. to find
the average residence time, you must multiply by the service time.

When \\(m\\) is 1 or 2, the Erlang formula simplifies exactly to the heuristic.
When \\(m=3\\), the Erlang formula simplifies to:

$$
R(3, \\rho) = 1 + \\frac{3\\rho^3}{(1-\\rho)(3\\rho^2+4\\rho+2)}
$$

It's not immediately obvious to me how that might be related to the heuristic
form of the response time stretch factor, \\(\\frac{1}{1-\\rho^3}\\).

At \\(m=4\\), the Erlang formula simplifies to

$$
R(4, \\rho) = 1 + \\frac{8\\rho^4}{(1-\\rho)(8\\rho^3+24\\rho^2-15\\rho+15)}
$$

The relationship between this and \\(\\frac{1}{1-\\rho^4}\\) is is no more
obvious to me. Importantly, I think, at this point the Erlang formula and the
heuristic start behaving very differently. With 3 service channels, the formulas
have essentially the same shapes (same poles, etc), but there's a slight ripple
in one that's not in the other.

But with 4 service channels they're
fundamentally different over portions of their range (outside the physically
meaningful performance region of \\(0<=\\rho<=1\\), that is).

What is the error in the heuristic for 3 and 4 service channels? I touched on
this briefly in the previous post. By subtracting the heuristic from the
Erlang formula and simplifying, I found that when there are 3 service channels,
the difference is

$$
\\frac{\\rho^3}{3\\rho^4+7\\rho^3+9\\rho^2+6\\rho+2}
$$

But with 4, the difference between the functions isn't expressible neatly, and
is sometimes infinity, reinforcing the impression that the coincidence between
Erlang and heuristic is just that.

I still feel that something useful is hiding just around the corner, because the
heuristic arises analytically but doesn't scale correctly to more than 2 service
channels, and Erlang also arises analytically but is correct. The fact that they
are exactly the same for 1 and 2 service channels just doesn't feel accidental.
But intuition has led me astray many times.

You can graph and visualize all of the above with a [Desmos
calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kvffq77evl) that I made for you.
