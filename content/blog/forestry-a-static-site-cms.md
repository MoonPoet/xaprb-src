[Forestry](https://forestry.io) is a content management system that runs in your browser. On the backend, it integrates with a static site generator such as Hugo, letting you edit your static website in your browser just like any other content management system. I am writing this blog post with it on my iPad, using voice dictation.

Setup was very easy, and although I had a slight hiccup importing my existing site, which is large, their support team was responsive and got that taken care of quickly.

Editing appears to be very straightforward so far, and I do not see any problems that seem to be showstoppers. I am seeing some unwanted newlines and capitalization behavior in the markdown editor, but that doesn't bother me too much.

Uploading an image may prove to be slightly challenging. It feels 99% functional, but the last 1% is confusing. I am not sure where the image I uploaded has gone, and when I publish this I am not sure if it will be broken.

It is worth mentioning that the location where the source code for my site is hosted has not changed. All I did was authorize Forestry to access and change that source code.

I will not exercise the full set of capabilities of this product. I host my site using an amazing static site hosting service called [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). They take care of watching for changes in the repository, fetching the changes, building the site from that source, and publishing that on their content delivery network. If I were not using this service, I think [Forestry](https://forestry.io) could cover some of those needs.
