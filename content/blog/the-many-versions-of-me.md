tldr: "Past and future versions of me are present within me in the now. This follows naturally from the observation that I'm able to remember thoughts and feelings from long ago."

A couple of weeks ago I recalled a thought from long ago, and with it the feelings.
I was able to access, with some degree of fidelity, the state of my mind and body at a point in the past.
Nothing unusual; something I'm sure we all do a lot.
But this ability, which seemed ordinary until that moment, suddenly struck me as remarkable, with far-reaching implications.

One idea led to another as I followed the train of thoughts about what it means that a human being can recall their previous thoughts and emotions.

It means that past states of being are somehow encoded within my present state.
It means that present-me contains at least a small part of every past-me.
It's a little reminiscent of "track changes" in a document, except that the old versions of me are probably not fully retained.

There's more.
Future-me is present here, now.

This is not an original thought.
It's an expression of several concepts in Buddhist schools of thought, as well as various philosophies and theologies.
I'd just never seen so clearly before how it applies to my concepts of self and passage of time.

I am not a singular self.
There are many parts of me at each moment in time, all of which are present in all moments.
Not only "[I am we](/blog/i-am-we/)," but *we* are we.
