tldr: "As I've shared things that work for me, I'm uncomfortably aware that they're similar to Silicon Valley standards that I don't like appearing to endorse. From CrossFit workouts to meditation, many things that have been life-changing for me are also co-opted by impostors who use those powers for harm, not good."

I've become uneasy with a stereotype about one of the roles I play in life, as a company founder.
It's the stereotype of the "hustling," driven founder or CEO who's always on the go, worshipping productivity for its own sake, and "successful" because of their extraordinary focus and resolve.
A lot of these folks, particularly in technology and especially in Silicon Valley, promote these stories about their superhuman achievements, and may even seriously strive to live the stories.
<!--more-->

"But Baron," you say, "you do some of the stuff they do, or you have at one time or another."
And it's true.
But I think I do it for different reasons and with a different perspective.
And that's why I really am uncomfortable with how much my behavior is similar to people I not only don't admire, but actively seek to distance myself from.

To illustrate this, let me build a straw man.
He is a technology founder and CEO.
He takes cold showers, works out at CrossFit, meditates, and does intermittent fasting.
He is featured on the front cover of Fast Company, and in the article they talk about how he curses and smiles at the same time, and how he commands everyone's attention when he walks into the room.
He has a cup of bulletproof coffee in each hand, and says he's in ketosis two days out of the week and sleeps four hours a night.
And he does this stuff because it improves his "cognitive performance."

Why don't I like this guy?
What's he done wrong?
Nothing, yet, but let me go on.

You see, he not only meditates, but he tweets about how he finds the pain in his legs really interesting during meditation---and people with chronic pain should try it, it might teach them to embrace their pain.
And the purpose of his meditation isn't to see more deeply into the causes of human suffering, and God forbid his contributions to it, but to hear rap songs with greater clarity.
And when he promotes what works for him, he uses phrases like "evidence-based," because it sounds scientific even though it's just anecdotes from his personal experience, but he's sure that is just as good.
When he talks about his "life hacks," he also talks about the Law of Attraction and other coded pseudo-metaphysics-babble stuff from *The Secret*, implying that if the Universe isn't aligning itself with *your* desires and plans, it's because you lack faith in yourself.
Oh, he also is a white guy who refuses to condemn the white supremacists who use his products to advance their agendas.

Am I getting warmer now?

It's not that meditation is bad, or [skipping a meal](/blog/skipping-breakfast/), or CrossFit, or cold showers, or any of this stuff.
It's that the people who brag about how it gives them superpowers, and attribute their exceptional lot in life to their heightened performance that we all could achieve if only we had the willpower and persistence to do so, all seem to be cluelessly out of touch with their privilege.
To an astonishing degree, this seems to describe each and every one of them.

A world which is filled, in their view, with people who they think are too lazy or afraid or whatever, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. People who don't *deserve* success.

They can't see that their situation in life isn't always to their own credit.
It's often due to privilege that they're unconscious of, and can't understand that others don't have.
In fact, their success is often not only built on their privilege, but directly results from oppression of the people they're criticizing.
They become caricatures of various types of privilege and supremacy, upheld by and upholding systems like patriarchy, class and racial prejudice, and a host of other subtle and overt messages about who is and deserves to be superior: those who are able, thin, young, pretty by some standard, and so on.

They also have such a superficial understanding of their supposed "life hacks" that it's laughable from a scientific point of view.
This is why I only speak about the so-called "Paleo" diet ironically, to use one example.

Yes, I meditate.
But I do it to gain insight, not productivity.
I do it to recover from traumatic experiences that have made it difficult for me to empathize and connect with others.

Yes, I work out.
But I do it so that my body is as useful as possible in the service of the things I have dedicated myself to, not so that I can feel superior to others.

Yes, I take cold showers sometimes.
Yes, I tried bulletproof coffee, against my better judgment to humor a coworker, and I did it *once* and never will do it again.
No, I don't drink Red Bull and never even tried it; there are limits.

So when I write about skipping breakfast, I'm acutely conscious that this is a luxury for me.
I've got great DNA, which I didn't earn.
And I don't have eating disorders, also through no virtue of my own.
So I have the privilege of being able to skip a meal, and for me it doesn't take on the meaning of disordered eating in the guise of productivity, which it would for a lot of people in different circumstances.

And when I write about meditation, I'm writing about trying to become more loving, not more prosperous.
Because there's enough money for everyone, but far too little love.

In other words, I do a lot of the same behaviors you can read about in *Inc* magazine, but I don't do them to conform to the standards set in Silicon Valley.
Externally, though, I worry that the difference is invisible.
And I'm not just worrying about what people will think about me.
It's not a vanity thing, not an ego trip.
I want to make a positive difference in people's lives, not contribute my vote to the harmful stereotype of what a successful, valuable, desirable person "should" look and behave like.
I don't like endorsing stuff that's been co-opted in service of that idealized persona.

I don't have a solution to any of this, but it felt really important to write, because every time I share something that I've learned about myself, it seems that shortly afterwards that very same thing shows up in a ghastly Silicon Valley hustle-porn culture incident, in the worst light.
And then I realize that the stuff I'm blogging or tweeting about could be triggering for a lot of people.
Within my bubble it's innocent, but outside my bubble there's lots of people for whom this is deeply personal and seems to lend substance---or perhaps *does* lend substance---to the behaviors of their oppressors.

I'm not going to quit meditating, working out, skipping breakfast, journaling in cursive, or any of the other things I've discovered that have been so instrumental in helping me grow and improve.
And I'm not going to quit sharing, because sharing is caring.
But hopefully if I cross a line, through cluelessness or accident, someone will help me become aware and I can remedy it.
That seems to be the best I can hope for, because inaction isn't an option.
