People love to say "strategy" and "strategic" because it makes them sound good.
But in my experience, most people have only a vague idea of what it really means.
The definitions I found are just fluff and confusion, so I created my own.

My definition of strategy:

> A strategy is a plan to prioritize resources to achieve the desired objectives optimally, while considering the most important constraints and circumstances.

I'll break that down bit by bit.

**A plan**. A strategy elucidates, at least at a high level, *how* you will
achieve a stated goal. More precisely, it lays out the *best way* to achieve the
goal. The strategy is the means to the end.

**To prioritize resources.** Inherent in the notion of achieving the goal in the
best way is that the strategy deploys resources---such as time, money, or
talent---in such a way as to amplify their contributions to the goal. In other
words, the strategy is a statement of the way to get the most leverage from
assets.

**To achieve the desired objectives optimally.** The strategy is not the
objectives. It's the best way to achieve the objectives. Sometimes I hear people
say things like "our strategy is to reach $10 million in recurring revenue
within 5 years." That's usually a mistake; that's usually[^1] a goal or
objective.

**While considering constraints and circumstances.** A strategy doesn't exist in
a vacuum. It's a way to balance resources with headwinds and tailwinds to get
leverage. What macro forces and trends make the strategy the *right* strategy?
An arm wrestler's strategy might be to try to make their opponent laugh, thereby
weakening their arms; or it might be to anger their opponent and make them
expend energy inefficiently and tire quickly. It depends on their opponent's
characteristics, and you don't know it's the right strategy unless you know what
weakens the opponent. Similarly, if a company has a lot of cash but not much
market visibility, and another company has little cash but an incredible
reputation, their strategies for market dominance should probably be different.

A strategy, therefore, should answer the questions *how do we think we can best
achieve our goals?* and *why have we decided to do X instead of Y?* It should
give people context while they're trying to execute, communicating commander's
intent so they can adapt to situations they haven't been instructed about
explicitly.  They should be empowered to make good decisions in the battlefield,
when the conditions on the ground demand swift adaptation and checking in with
commanding officers isn't an option. The strategy doesn't answer *what*, though.
That's what the objective is for.

"Take the hill!" is the objective. "Under cover of darkness because it's a new
moon, at peak fog time when the enemy spotlights won't work" is the strategy.

[^1]: It depends; if the strategy is really not about revenue, and the revenue is just the means to the end, then the revenue target *could* be the strategy; but you'll still need a strategy to achieve your strategy.
