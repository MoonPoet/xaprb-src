Here is a collection of upcoming events that are interesting to me as a MySQL user (in some cases because I'm speaking). I think some of them are must-see events. I am sure I am missing a lot of events, but some of these are only publicized in specific channels, and I wanted to mention them here to help spread the word.

### Upcoming Meetups

This coming Thursday, Charlottesville's Neon Guild tech group will [co-host a Meetup with a noted Kanban expert](http://agile-cville-march-meeting.eventbrite.com/).

I'm joining two Meetups soon to talk about building database (MySQL) applications with the Go programming language:

*   [Wednesday, March 13, 2013 in Charlottesville Virginia](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-MySQL-Meetup/events/106865662/)
*   [Tuesday, March 19, 2013 in Alexandria, Virginia](http://www.meetup.com/Golang-DC/events/106865142/)

### Upcoming Conferences

*   [Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo 2013](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/) in Santa Clara, CA April 22-25, 2013. This is **the** annual MySQL conference. I'm not speaking this year, but...
*   [Velocity Web Performance And Operations Conference](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013) June 18-20, Santa Clara, CA. This is an amazing event that brings together the best and brightest people who are building the future of the Internet. I am speaking on [quantifying system normality](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/detail/28118).
