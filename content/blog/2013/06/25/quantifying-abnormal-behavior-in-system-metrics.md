I've posted [slides for my Velocity talk on VividCortex's blog](https://vividcortex.com/blog/2013/06/25/quantifying-abnormal-behavior/). The talk explained how we use exponentially weighted moving statistics to generate a meta-metric of abnormality for the time-series metrics measured from MySQL. That's kind of a mouthful. Maybe you had to be there :-)
