Last night at the [Golang-DC meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Golang-DC/events/106865142/) I spoke about building (MySQL) database applications with Go. The meetup was well attended and people were very enthusiastic about Go. I spent a few minutes talking about Go in general, how [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) uses Go (we've built our agents, API servers, and all backend processes with Go), why we like it, some of the nice things it enables like making it easy to build very [resilient programs](/blog/2013/03/14/crash-injection-for-writing-resilient-software/ "Crash injection for writing resilient software"), and then I gave the presentation, which I've embedded below.

Afterwards the discussion ranged to a lot of related topics. This was the best part of the evening for me. There were really great questions on a variety of topics, and insightful answers from everyone.
