I've been continuing to study how companies articulate their [core values](/blog/core-values/) to learn how different leaders think.
There's a lot written about core values, lots of advice in leadership books about how to establish your values, but I wanted to see what people actually do, not what they say they do.
As I did this, patterns began to emerge, and it's pretty clear to me now that various leaders use values in different ways.
I came away from this convinced that you can tell a lot about a company by studying what *types* of values they have, and what the company's purpose in having values appears to be.

* Descriptors of people --- Netflix describes an ideal team member
* Vision of the ideal team/company
* Expectations of behaviors by individuals

Big companies are kind of like posting values as a smoke screen, an "indulgence" so they can commit evil on a mass scale and point to good on a small scale.

The rest of this post will consist of quoting various company values and a little light commentary.

### Netflix

> Below are our real values, the specific behaviors and skills we care about most...
>
> **Judgment**
>
> * You make wise decisions despite ambiguity
> * You identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms
> * You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do
> * You are good at using data to inform your intuition
> * You make decisions based on the long term, not near term

Netflix's [values](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) are a huge list (the above is just one of many points).
All of these values *describe characteristics of people and their behaviors.*
Netflix is plainly describing the people they will hire and keep, and by extension, their expectations of those people.
It's also clear that these are not things they expect people to "try" to do.
It's about results: "You accomplish amazing amounts of important work," for example.
Grammatically, they are all exactly parallel: there is no variation; they all have the same structure.
The takeaway is that Netflix is deadly serious and absolutely clear about their values and what they mean.

### Comcast

> Comcast's culture is built on integrity and respect---with the goal of working together to drive ourselves and our businesses to always be creative, innovative and competitive. Our core values guide us day in and day out. We are guided by:
> 
> - An entrepreneurial spirit to embrace good ideas, bring them to life quickly, and constantly look for new ways to innovate for our customers.
> - Acting with integrity. It's as simple as doing what's right and treating people the right way.
> - Respect for each other. From the very beginning, we have been committed to a culture of fairness, respect, and inclusion: within our leadership and our workforce, with our suppliers, in our programming, and in the communities we serve.
> - Giving back to the community. We have a long history of supporting local communities and organizations, developing programs and partnerships, and mobilizing our resources to connect people and inspire positive and substantive change.

Comcast's [values](https://corporate.comcast.com/values) are meant to inspire.
They are grandiose, but nonspecific.
They attempt to describe the company in general terms, rather than being addressed to employees as Netflix does.
If they were addressed to each individual at the company, you could use them to give specific feedback in a performance review, for example.
But Comcast's values would be impossible to hold anyone accountable to.
They are also a grab-bag of different types of statements: some are an assertion that something is true, others are a report that an activity occurs or takes place, and so on.
It's easy to pick on Comcast, so I won't go into further details, other than to say "plausible deniability" is probably the category they all fall into.

### Wells Fargo

> Five primary values guide every action we take:
> 
> * **What's right for customers**. We place customers at the center of everything we do. We want to exceed customer expectations and build relationships that last a lifetime.
> * **People as a competitive advantage**. We strive to attract, develop, motivate, and retain the best team members --- and collaborate across businesses and functions to serve customers.
> * **Ethics**. We're committed to the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and principled performance. We do the right thing, in the right way, and hold ourselves accountable.
> * **Diversity and inclusion**. We value and promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of business and at all levels. Success comes from inviting and incorporating diverse perspectives.
> * **Leadership. We're all called to be leaders**. We want everyone to lead themselves, lead the team, and lead the business --- in service to customers, communities, team members, and shareholders.

Wells Fargo's [values](https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/vision-and-values/) are vague and many are non-actionable, like Comcast's.
But unlike Comcast's, at least Wells Fargo's values are cohesive: each appears to be a statement of things the company "believes in," for whatever that's worth.
There's a similarity that runs through them.

### WillowTree

> **Core Values**
> 
> We have lots of fun doing work we love---and these tenets drive everything we do.
> 
> 1. **Craft**. We aim for excellence, and our love for what we do compels us to reach a higher standard. You can be proud of the work you do here.
> 2. **Sustainable Flow**. The state of mind when time flies and energy is focused. We make time for it every day so we can create innovative solutions that people love.
> 3. **Ownership**. We have a strong sense of individual responsibility. Every initiative has an owner, from major product strategy to curating which kombucha is on tap.
> 4. **Optimism**. We acknowledge and understand the reality of the challenges we face, and we always find a way forward.
> 5. **Open Communication**. We respect one another enough to give and receive honest feedback. We champion the best ideas, no matter where they originate.
> 6. **Partnership**. Working side by side, we build meaningful connections with each other and our clients.
> 7. **Inclusion**. We treat each other with consideration and respect, and we celebrate our differences with tolerance and inclusion. You know, the way we want to be treated.

WillowTree's [values](https://www.willowtreeapps.com/careers) are a mixed collection of statements of *qualities or experiences you might expect to encounter at the company*.
I can categorize them as descriptions of the company's personality (culture).
These values are for attracting a specific type of employee---one who is focused on having an experience, living their best life.

### Coupa

Coupa states their values and then defines them with short essays.

> **ENSURE CUSTOMER SUCCESS**<br>
> Long live customer success!
>  
> **FOCUS ON RESULTS**<br>
> We want to see quantifiable results.
>  
> **STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE**<br>
> Our customers are more than just another client.
> 
> **ENSURE CUSTOMER SUCCESS**
> 
> Where industry has traditionally focused on customer satisfaction, Coupa focuses on customer success. To us, customer success is more than just an aspirational job title or a new spin on the customer service function. It's an evolution of customer service, requiring new skill sets and mindsets to staff our customer success organization
> 
> What Does This Mean For You?
> 
> The customer success model aligns the interests of Coupa with the interests of the customer in a quantifiable way. We are much more proactively involved in a customer's success over customer service, which has historically functioned more as an ad-hoc troubleshooting service driven by upsell opportunities. You won't find that here at Coupa. We are in it to win it with you.
> 
> **FOCUS ON RESULTS**
> 
> We firmly believe we are accountable to our customers to produce results. We want our customers to be so impacted by Coupa that they cannot imagine their life without it (or remember their life before it). That is why achieving real, tangible, positive results are built into the DNA of our company, and every employee and partner we work with.
> 
> What Does This Mean For You?
> 
> There aren't many enterprise software companies out there who want to be held accountable to their results. With this as a core value at Coupa, our customers not only know they will see results, they expect it - that's the type of "good company" we surround ourselves with. We see it as our most important responsibility, day in and day out, to produce results for our customers. That's our bottomline.
> 
> **STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE**
> 
> Striving for excellence is about never lowering the bar. Too many customers have fallen victim to the sub-par attitude and behaviors of their vendors --- once they sign the deal, get their reference and the logo recognition, they're gone and the client rarely hears from them again. We strive for success by raising the bar for ourselves, our customers and for the enterprise software market.
> 
> What Does This Mean For You?
> 
> Here at Coupa, we constantly ask the question "How can we be better than we were yesterday?" This way of thinking ensures our customers are not only receiving great results, but are getting the best we can offer on a day to day basis. We are constantly improving and innovating which means our customers have the best product the market has to offer --- bar none.

Coupa's [values](https://www.coupa.com/company/core-values/) are focused 100% on their *customers*.
The intended audience of this web page isn't employees, it's customers (or prospective customers).
When they write, "What Does This Mean For You?" the "You" is a customer.
The entire Coupa values statement emphasizes and reemphasizes in many different ways: they have only one value, which is to over-deliver to their customers.
Coupa is maniacally customer-focused.

### Honeycomb

> **"Fast and close to right is better than perfect"**
> * Take pride in your craft and ship relentlessly.
> * Use your judgment. Ask forgiveness, not permission.
> * "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good"
> * *Code in production is worth two in canary*.

Honeycomb's [values](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-values-2018/) are those of a relatively early company, prudently not doing too much too soon.
It's possible to find many companies' values statements and see how they grew and changed over time; for example I found a couple of versions of Okta's.
Honeycomb's values are meant to signal principles they believe in and try to live by giving instructions as to how.

### Others

I reviewed the values of a variety of other companies big and small, early and mature.
In some cases it was hard for me to divine the intention behind the values.
Microsoft, for example.
In others I saw more examples of the types of things I wrote above.

What is clear is that regardless of how polished or skillful the values statements seem to be, their values statements reveal a lot about them.
What is the purpose of your core values?
Do they work as intended?
