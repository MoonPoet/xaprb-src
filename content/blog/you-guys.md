This article is written as food for thought for men.
I've witnessed a lot of debate in the last few years about whether "you guys" is gender-neutral.
It doesn't surprise me that a lot of men think it is, and women say it's not.
It doesn't surprise me that people point to the dictionary definition, which says it's gender-neutral.
All this is natural, given our culture, and I'd be surprised if people didn't do these things.
But we can do better, we should, and many of us do.
<!--more-->

After spending a few years working very intentionally to [listen to women](/blog/what-women-tell-me/), this doesn't strike me as even a close debate.
The objective facts, as I see them, are not to be found in the dictionary or in some appeal to another authority.
Anyone who takes a little time to listen and observe will find the following to be true in their own experience and that of others:

- Guys is gendered in usage, no matter what the dictionary says.
- Addressing a mixed-gender group as "guys" is not inclusive when spoken by a man, because of the inter-group power dynamics.
- Because of those same dynamics, women can freely call each other "guys" without giving men license to use the same term in the same way or to complain about it.
- There are obvious and easy alternatives in common usage that are gender-neutral and inclusive, and men should use them.
- Men who stop using this term aren't impoverished in the least; to the contrary, they enrich themselves and empower others.

You can stop there if you want, but read on for more about these points below.

### Is Guys Gender-Neutral?

No. It simply is not gender-neutral. That's not how real people use it in the real world.

Do you have sex with "guys" or "gals"?
If women are "guys," are men "gals"?
Do you address mixed-gender groups as "gals"?

> Pro tip: "Guys" is gendered. Think it's not? Swap it out for "gals" for a day and see what happens.

Go ahead, address folks as "you gals" next time you're speaking/writing to a group. Remember: if the setting is formal, "ladies" might be more appropriate.
(This should only be a thought experiment.
If you actually do this, you're being a jerk.)

The dictionary is wrong.

Guys isn't the only word that people fight over in this way.
Looking at other hotly contested "gender neutral" words that aren't gender-neutral is instructive, because the same reasons they aren't gender-neutral apply to guys, too.

For example, "craftsman" isn't gender-neutral. A satirical example makes it clear:

> [manwhohasitall](https://twitter.com/manwhohasitall/status/989942282802683905)
>
> "The word craftswomanship is obviously gender-neutral and covers both women and men. The world has way too many problems to be offended by language." John, male craftswoman

Or, try this one:

> [Steve Rogalsky](https://twitter.com/srogalsky/status/991431460681854976)
>
> A fond memory from my university days: I was seeking to understand why we can't use "mankind" or "men" for all cases. A wise woman asked me to name 10 famous men. I named 10 famous males, and no females. Her point exactly.  That's the problem with using craftsmen for all cases.

I cannot say it better than that.
When we pretend the default male gender is "neutral" and then do some easy experiments, its ostensible neutrality is obviously false---a proof by contradiction that it's not neutral.
We live in a sexist culture and we have to be anti-sexist, not neutral, or we're reinforcing its biases.

### Guys Isn't Inclusive, Especially When Men Say It

Guys simply isn't inclusive.
Put aside technicalities; don't get sucked into debating definitions.^["The key is not to get sucked into a debate about whether something is "technically" offensive or not. There is rarely an objectively "correct" answer. Instead, anchor your discussion on the fact that a team gets to decide what it values as a community, and what behaviors are aligned with that." -- via [Inclusion at Work](https://inclusionatwork.co/difficult-feedback-about-offensive-behavior/)]
Just listen to what people say about how they feel when called "guys," and you'll hear that not all people feel included, for very good reasons.
That's all the evidence you should need.
But, don't just take my word for it, let's listen a bit.

> Good morning Twitter, your periodic reminder that "Hey guys" is not inclusive language, This is even more glaring when its used to address a specific set of people which is all men and one woman.
>
> Signed Caitie & The Guys.

I once saw a tweet saying, "I don't like being called "guys" because multiple coworkers have separately told me that I could never be one of the guys and that shit hurts." I saved the tweet but not the author or the URL.

Consider Silvia's reaction when AWS CEO Andy Jassy called DBAs "guys" during a keynote address:

> [Silvia Botros](https://twitter.com/dbsmasher/status/1067826295382278145)
>
> You guys... cus all DBAs are guys ðŸ˜’#reInvent

It *bothered* Silvia. Don't argue whether that's wrong or right. It bothered her so much that she mentioned it in another venue, on [a podcast where she was a guest](https://www.realworlddevops.com/episodes/episode-001-silvia-botros):

> Silvia: It's funny you mentioned that because in a [recent keynote by Andy Jassy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOIkOnW640A) who's the CEO of AWS, that's the thing he definitely beat on. Where he basically called DBA's the old guard and that "those guys", and I quote those guys, are basically sitting in the way of engineers building things.

Or consider this,

> [Jessica DeVita](https://twitter.com/UberGeekGirl/status/984085999985688576)
>
> Everytime this vendor says "guys" on a call with several technical women, I just want to scream.

Or this one,

> [Mary Dickson Diaz](https://twitter.com/marythought/status/1044787788531396608)
> 
> Right, it's describing you and the dominant tech culture so you've probably never even thought about it. Whereas it grates on me every single time I hear it.

I'm not Googling for these tweets.
These are tweets that I've been seeing in my timeline, from women I follow.
All I've done is collect them for a few months.
They're often retweeted by several other women, which means a lot more people are feeling this way than tweeting about it.
Here's another:

> [Michelle Noorali](https://twitter.com/michellenoorali/status/984087098197184513)
>
> It is not gender neutral and it stings every time. When I accidentally say "you guys", I try to remember to add "and gals" to it.

And that brings up my next point: is it inclusive when women say it?

### But Women Say It Too

So what?
There are lots of ethnic, racial, gender, and other groups where it's okay for members of that group to say things and not okay for outsiders to do it.
As men, we should *shut the hell up* about this.
Women can work out their own agreements amongst themselves, without any help from men.
They don't need to be mansplained about being women, of all things.

Lest anyone accuse me of being clueless, however, a lot of women recognize that they can be more inclusive when they don't say you guys, and express that they're trying to unlearn this phrase:

> [Caitie McCaffrey](https://twitter.com/caitie/status/1044686214261948417)
>
> A few years back I made a concerted effort to remove "guys" from my vocabulary when referring to mix gendered groups.  It wasn't easy and required thought and effort, but that's the cool thing! As people we can evolve, so can language & cultures.

One of the replies to that tweet:

> [Amy](https://twitter.com/amyfriske/status/1044646131228004352)

> As a mid-westerner, it was difficult for me to stop saying "you guys" when women are in the group. After I read [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6/) from Business Insider, I understood I need to change. I use 'y'all' now. It works.

The link leads to an article featuring maps of American phrase usage. Here's the map in question:

![How Americans address a group of two or more people](/media/2019/02/you-guys.png)

Source: [Speaking American: How Y'all, Youse, and You Guys Talk: A Visual Guide: Josh Katz]({{< amz 0544703391 >}})

That map shows why "you guys" is such a hard habit to kick: it's the cultural norm through a lot of America.^[So is sexism. It's no excuse not to do better.]
But hard or no, people who care enough can make the effort and make the change.
And as men, when we see women working to do this, we should work twice as hard.

> I, like Caitie, used to say "guys" all the time but have made an effort to change my language. Know better, do better.

### But Everyone Else Is Doing It Too

Who is this "everyone" you're speaking of?
Is it, perhaps, "everyone" in a male-dominated industry like technology?

Everyone isn't doing it, and it's not just women who object and are trying to change.
Tons of guys are making the effort to do better, too.
Here's one,

> [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/986297696913772544)
>
> Ugh. Stop calling a room full of people "guys." #devopsdays

Or this one,

> [jay](https://twitter.com/jaydestro/status/986662016130560001)
>
> If there's a room full of men, women and non-binary folks, don't call them "guys" plz.

Or this one,

> [Ben M. Schorr](https://twitter.com/bschorr/status/984086882702131200)
>
> I always used that term generically, but I totally get how it's not always received that way, so I try to catch myself and use more gender-neutral terms.

Which is practically a copy-paste (a good thing!) of this advice from Better Allies:

> [Better Allies](https://twitter.com/betterallies/status/1033065750615838720)
>
> I try not to use "guys" to refer to a group of people. Women and non-binary people don't need another reminder they're working in a male-dominated culture. If it slips out, I simply add, "Excuse me, I meant to say you all."

### It's Too Hard To Break The Habit

Not true.
Just not true.
If you aren't willing to work to change, ask yourself how much you *really* value women and empathize with their experiences?
Corey Quinn again:

> [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1084881429236834306)
>
> "It's too hard to remove 'guys' from my vocabulary."

> @estherschindler taught me I was putting two spaces after a period and to stop doing it years ago. It took me a solid year to break the habit. You're not saying it's too hard; you're just saying it's not important.

Another thought about difficulty of breaking a habit versus how much you care:

> [Samantha Zeitlin](https://twitter.com/SamanthaZeitlin/status/1046457660936089600)
>
> Minor epiphany: "you guys" bothers me a lot more in writing than in conversation. In writing I feel like you have no excuse not to review your word choice before hitting send.

### There Are No Good Alternatives

Ah, the excuse of last resort. Any port in a storm.

Try these excellent alternatives that you already use many times a day, comfortably, for other things:

- Folks
- Team
- Everyone
- People
- Friends
- Everybody
- You all
- Y'all

> One of my good friends at work got me using "friends", which I love. Starting training sessions with "Hello friends, here's what we're going to learn today" #devops #hugops

I understand that some people don't want to say "y'all," and that's fine, but it's a pretty acceptable word in most of the areas shaded red or orange above.
Most of the USA, in fact.

> "nerds" is also gender-neutral, I'm just saying

### Why Fight So Hard To Keep It?

As a parting note, I'd like to say that I understand if people don't yet realize why "you guys" isn't inclusive.
If you're an American, you grew up unconsciously using it and didn't think much about it.
If you're a non-native English speaker, you're getting mixed signals---and I've seen a lot of people struggling with this when they are not fluent in English.

All very understandable.
But after reading this blog post, you should be very clear that "you guys" isn't inclusive and is undesirable.
You don't have to be perfect.
It takes time and effort to change habits.
You will be forgiven for mistakes, especially if you're able to catch yourself, apologize as Better Allies demonstrated above, and move on.

What's not acceptable is men who fight to assert and retain the right to say "you guys" to mixed groups.
They're fighting to maintain a toxic power dynamic---to maintain psychological dominance over women by signaling to them that they aren't equal, they don't belong.
This is a huge red flag in my personal experience.
I have several times seen a man argue passionately that the dictionary should prevail, and in every single case that man had other problematic behaviors too.
