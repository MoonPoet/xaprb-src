Over the past few months, I've been invited to be a guest on several podcasts that focus on DevOps and software engineering.

You can find these podcasts on iTunes or anywhere else you listen to podcasts.

* Real World DevOps

    The [Real World DevOps](https://www.realworlddevops.com/) podcast is hosted by Mike Julian, with a theme of introducing listeners to the most interesting people in the DevOps community.
    Our conversation ranged from my technique for writing books, thoughts on culture change, and what I've been learning recently about bias, privilege, and empathy.

* On-Call Nightmares

    The [On-Call Nightmares](https://oncallnightmares.podomatic.com/) podcast is hosted by Jay Gordon ([@jaydestro](https://twitter.com/jaydestro)) and features stories from technologists about being on-call.
    My own stories range from being on-call at a tech startup, to memories from taking care of animals on the farm where I grew up, and being an Emergency Medical Technician on a volunteer rescue squad.

* Arrested DevOps

    The [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/) podcast is co-hosted by several amazing DevOps community leaders.
    The episode I joined was hosted by [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron) and [Matty Stratton](https://twitter.com/mattstratton), and focused on bringing DevOps to the database.
