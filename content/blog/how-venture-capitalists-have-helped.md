title: How Venture Capitalists Have Helped Me
---

Venture capital is a competitive industry. Investors compete to win the best
companies, so they pitch founders on the value they bring to their portfolio
companies. When I was a new founder, their pitches didn't resonate with me. I
found it difficult to understand how they could help. A few years later, I get
it; they really can add value. This is what I've found so far.

When I first began speaking to potential venture capital investors, I felt as
though their pitches to me were all variations on "you'll get access to our
network." This fell on mostly deaf ears. At that point in my career, it was
actually an anti-value for me. My experience of "networking" was associated with
cliques and special privileges shared between people based on belonging to a
club. It sounded like a fraternity's pitch to a would-be pledge, to be honest.

At this point I've had a few years' experience working with some fairly active
and involved investors, and on reflection, I see more of the value than I did at
the beginning.  If I were to explain this to past-me, here's what I might try to
emphasize.

### Recruiting

In the early years, I didn't understand how important it would be to hire
carefully, nor how difficult and time-consuming it would be. I thought I was
good at hiring, but I was wrong. This is a book-length topic, but my venture
capital investors have helped in several concrete ways between then and now.

- **Selecting a recruiter.** Recruiters have turned out to be far more important
  than I'd expected. My executive recruiter, in particular, has become an
  extension of my team and a true partner to the business. But recruiting, as an
  industry, in many ways deserves the reputation it has. Exceptional recruiters
  are exceptional. My investors helped me find a recruiter who is good for me
  and for our business.  Without my investors' recruiting services, I'd probably
  have hired a bad recruiter, or one who was good at something I didn't need (or
  good for a different company but not mine), wasted a lot of time and money,
  and potentially even failed to find good people for vital positions at crucial
  moments in the company's growth.  This is a life-and-death matter. The
  in-house recruiting specialists at my investors have made a huge difference
  here.
- **Introductions.** Several of my most important hires have come through the
  wisdom and judgment of my investors combined with their extensive networks.
  Timing is so, so important. By knowing the right person at the right time,
  they've helped find the needle in the haystack.
- **Closing.** High-performing people are rarely "on the job market" and are
  careful with their careers. Joining an early-stage startup with a first-time
  founder/CEO is a pretty risky move.  Without investors, many people never
  would have even started a conversation with me, and the investors have been
  instrumental in getting to yes.  The investors have helped explain what they
  saw in the company and its opportunity, lending an independent, third-party
  perspective that I would be unable to. "Why did you invest in this company?"
  is an answer only an investor can give. 
- **Understanding The Market.** My investors have a much broader view of what's
  normal and expected in the industry, and can quickly give advice and guidance
  on what's going to work and won't in recruiting-related matters. They're
  scouts reporting from the front lines. They can help vet for common mistakes
  in our processes, provide data on compensation norms, give strategic advice on
  closing a particular candidate, and so on.

Note that my investors' recruiting services aren't for doing recruiting, per se.
They're for helping my company succeed in our own recruiting efforts.

### Planning And Cross-Checking

Investors, both actual and potential, have helped review and clarify my plans.
They have found things I overlooked, pointed out errors in my logic, and made my
models much more rigorous. They have helped me understand the common language of
things such as operating plans, showing me what types of models will be quick to
evaluate and provide good answers, as well as what's conventional and therefore
easy to pattern-match.

My board member at NEA, Arjun Aggarwal, has spent a great deal of time helping
build models for many aspects of the business, helping turn thoughts into
spreadsheets. This is not typical; board members aren't usually this active and
involved. Arjun adds a lot of value to the team by doing this.

Speaking to investors generally results in at least some type of challenge to my
thinking, even if very diplomatic. Every question is an effort to go a bit
deeper. When I speak to venture capitalists, I write down the questions they ask
me. Common themes always emerge. I am not a venture capitalist and don't think
like one. Being able to review my notes and see where I need to focus, both for
their sake and for mine, is invaluable to me.

### Pitch Practice And Feedback

I'm not a pitcher by nature. But virtually everything I do involves summarizing
the business's value, current status, and opportunity to someone, whether that's
a potential recruit, an investor, a partner, a customer, the board of directors,
the all-staff meetings, and so on. Venture capitalists provide feedback on how
well I'm doing that.

My investors have also gone beyond the call of duty to help me understand how to
pitch better, build a better deck, and helped me with pitch practice and
rehearsal. As I've leaned into this process, I've found it useful all day, every
day.

When I've pitched potential investors, I've found it very useful to note and
decode their feedback. Some will not say no in a direct way, leaning on
compliments followed by encouragement to stay in touch. Others will take time to
be very specific about why they've decided not to invest. Their feedback is
clear guidance as to what they think the business should focus on achieving. It
has to be taken with a grain of salt, but collating this feedback often results
in advice that's less conflicting than some other sources I've gone
to for help. It also points out where I'm just doing a bad job communicating our
strengths; I've gotten feedback that we should do X when, in fact, we already do
X and I just wasn't saying it very well.

### Press and Media Relations

Early startups generally can't and shouldn't spend money on an expensive PR
firm. Both of my major investors have PR staff and services who have helped us
with periodic work we otherwise wouldn't have had resources to do well.

Similar to recruiters, PR firms are probably a trap for founders pretty
often---not that they mean badly, but you need to know how to work with them or
you'll steer yourself astray. Working with our investors' PR experts instead of
with agencies has allowed us to get lots of help at particular times, without
taking a big risk on a long-term commitment.

### Introductions To Advisors

Various introductions to advisors, entrepreneurs-in-residence, and other helpful
people have come through my investors. Many of these people have generously
spent significant amounts of time with me and others on the team. We've dodged
many serious mistakes as a result. We've also seized on opportunities we didn't
see ourselves, and found alternative ways to do things that produced surprising
results at times. This is true both on the business and the technical sides.

### Conclusions

If you'd asked me in 2013, I think I would have said that investors were perhaps
exaggerating how much they could help us. I'd have said "all they do is say
they'll make introductions, and introductions are just going to use up precious
time I need to conserve." That's not what I've found.  I've received help I
didn't expect, didn't know I needed, and has made a big difference to the
business.

*PS: If I've omitted anything you've done for me, it's forgetfulness, not passive
aggressiveness.*
