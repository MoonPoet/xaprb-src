I grew up in the age of Internet Explorer versus Netscape, and frequently used
lesser-known browsers like Opera, Konqueror, and Phoenix. I don't know why, but I just didn't want to use
mainstream browsers. And for some reason, that has remained true over time.  I'm
currently using [Brave](https://brave.com) as my default browser, but I use
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on a regular basis too.

The browser "wars" of the late '90s and early '00s seemed to have been "won,"
but in reality it's been a constant competition. At this point, Chrome has the
vast majority of the market share, but if history is any indication, that won't
remain true forever.

Personally, I'm not using Chrome because of Google's approach to privacy, but
that'll be a topic for another article someday. Meanwhile, I thought it might be
interesting to explain why I use Brave.

By way of explanation, I'll simply show high-level comparisons between the major
browsers.

|                             | Chrome        | Firefox   | Safari    | Brave    |
|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Speed                       | Good          | Poor      | Good      | Best     |
| Battery Drain               | Moderate      | Poor      | Best      | Good     |
| Privacy Controls            | Moderate      | High      | Moderate  | High     |
| Cookie and History Controls | Good          | Best      | Moderate  | Moderate |
| Addon Ecosystem             | Best in class | Good      | Limited   | Poor     |
| Ad Blocking                 | Via Addon     | Via Addon | Poor      | Best     |
| Reader View                 | Via Addon     | Excellent | Excellent | None     |
| Screenshot Support          | Via Addon     | Excellent | None      | None     |
| FIDO Key Support            | Yes           |           |           | Yes      |
| User Interface Design       | Good          | Good      | Good      | Buggy    |

In general, Brave is a fast browser that is based on the same underlying engine
as Chrome, but without the extra Google stuff on top of it. (It's not just a
re-skinned Chrome.) It therefore benefits from Chrome's speed and power, and
most of its features, but adds privacy and security features that I find
valuable.

What's wrong with Brave? It shows a ton of promise, but it's a little early.
Small things lack UI polish at times. It's really minor things, like the
clickable area of the address bar being smaller than it looks, so it's hard to
get the mouse into the address bar; or tabs not quite behaving perfectly at
times.

If you're a regular reader of my blog, you probably saw that I switched to
Firefox not long ago. I tried valiantly to make it work for me, and functionally
I like a lot about Firefox. (I'm a longtime loyalist). But it's just too slow.
It's borderline unusable. And it chews through battery at an amazing rate. I did
a lot of work to check if I was suffering from performance bugs, and I was---but
even after finding ways to work around those and improve performance, it's too
slow.

I find it useful to keep several browsers installed and use all of them on a
pretty regular basis. Firefox's screenshot abilities, for example, are amazing.
And Firefox and Safari both have a "reader view" that cleans up a web page and
formats it as an article for easy reading, which is such a great feature. I also
want to make sure that when I'm building things like this website, or using the
product we're building at VividCortex, that I use it in many different browsers
to ensure it works well and is fast.

What's interesting about *all* the browsers is that history-related features
seem to be a lower priority, in general, than I expected. I prefer to keep
history only for a week, and set my browser to delete cookies after I close the
tab or exit the browser, except for selected websites that I want to stay logged
into, like my email.

But most browsers lack what I expect to be basic features in that regard. Most
of them provide only some of the features I just listed. For example, Safari has
an option to remove history after a period of time, but Google Chrome simply
keeps history forever. You have to use an add-on to remove history. The same is
true of cookie controls: some browsers give enough control to let you keep
cookies you want and prevent keeping others, but most just treat cookies without
much nuance, making it hard for you to treat some cookies as "good" and others
as "unwanted."

In general, Google Chrome (and Google itself) worry me the most. Not about my
personal privacy, but about societal privacy en masse, because privacy online
isn't so much an individual concern as it is collective. Maybe at some point
I'll write about this, but for now if you're curious, you can do some searches
about their privacy policy changes, how CAPTCHAs are changing, and so on.

I use a Mac at present, so Microsoft Edge isn't an option for me, and Opera has
been purchased and put to different purposes. I remember when Opera.... was it
version 3.5...? was my main browser. It was faster and more advanced than others
back then.  I think I bought my first Opera license in 1998. Nostalgia!
