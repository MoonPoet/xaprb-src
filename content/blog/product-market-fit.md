The way I think about "product/market fit" has changed a lot over the years. I
now view it completely differently. It doesn't mean what I used to think it did.

The way I used to use "product/market fit" was something along the lines of: users are enthusiastic, word of mouth is positive, people are delighted, the app is a joy to use, it makes hard things easy, it nails the use case. In other words, the app solves a problem or meets a need in such a way that it makes users happy. I've built the right thing to do the right thing in the right way. Obviously product/market fit, right?

Nope. That's service/user fit, not product/market fit. It's not a bad thing, but it's _totally_ different. It took me a while to see that.

Let's dig into what "product" and "market" mean. The following discussion is especially informed by my experience in business-to-business, but the general concepts are just as true in B2C or other types of businesses.

### Product

A lot of people, especially engineers, especially past-me, think the product is the thing they build. I used to think it's the app, the service, the UI, the UX, the functionality. This couldn't be further from the truth. The product isn't what you _build_. The product is what you _sell_. It's easy to confuse one for the other, but vital to think clearly about this.

Let's take whiskey stones as an example. Look at listings on Amazon and you'll see sellers promoting the benefits of whiskey stones: chills your bourbon without diluting it with meltwater, makes a great gift for that discriminating whiskey drinker in your life, etc. Sounds legit, right?

But if you talk to a whiskey drinker, or just read the reviews, you get a different picture. "One star. My brother-in-law gave this to me. I know he meant well, but don't give these as a gift. They're just a hazard. Tilt the glass and they'll slide, smash your lips, break your teeth, and you'll end up paying thousands of dollars for dental repairs."

What's the product, really? Is it the stones? No, it's ostensibly chilled-but-not-diluted whiskey, but that's a red herring. The product is the _result or outcome_. To quote the famous line, people don't buy quarter-inch drill bits, they buy quarter-inch holes. The real product here, what the whiskey stone makers are selling, is a warm fuzzy feeling for people who think their brother-in-law is hard to buy for.

Similarly, the product isn't the dating app, it's companionship. It isn't [database monitoring](https://www.vividcortex.com/), it's improved revenue through a more responsive app or service. It isn't chat rooms, it's a more connected and efficient workforce with less need for meetings. (Arguably.)

Your product is what you sell, and you're not selling your app or service, you're selling the outcomes. You're selling [someone's next promotion](http://tomtunguz.com/the-business-of-selling-promotions/).

### Market

Similarly, I used to think of market very differently. The way I think of it now is: your market isn't your "user." Back to the whiskey stones again. Your market isn't whiskey drinkers. It's brother-in-laws.

In Geoffrey Moore's classic _Crossing the Chasm_, he defines a market as "a set of actual or potential customers, for a given set of products or services, who have a common set of needs or wants, and who reference each other when making a buying decision." All of the parts are important; there are no fluff words in that definition.

Just as important, though, is the clear understanding that the market is who you sell to. Who is Facebook's market? It isn't the billions of users on their service. It's the billions of advertisers! Who _buys_ your app or service? That's your _market_. If you're selling a dating app, your user and buyer are the same thing. If you're creating a free dating app that's ad-supported, your users and market are not the same.&dagger; When they're the same, it's just a coincidence. Many or perhaps even most products are sold to someone other than the user.

At VividCortex, for example, our users are developers, DBAs, technical operations teams, SREs, and the like. And, sure, these are our champions for promoting a sale internally, too. But we don't _sell_ to them, we sell to VPs and the C-suite and so on. In fact, we sell to _organizations_, not individuals.

### Product/Market Fit

My current understanding is this: you have product/market fit when you have created and clearly defined a _product_\* and it fits your _market's_ needs, _including how they buy_. If you haven't aligned your delivery mechanism with your market's purchasing mechanisms, you don't have product/market fit. For example, if you sell to the government, you probably have to go through approved channels and meet various types of regulatory approval. Otherwise nobody in the government can actually buy what you're selling.

To put this in terms of VividCortex again: we initially built a database monitoring service that made DBAs happy. Great! Nice service/user fit. Then we had to figure out how to sell it. Creating actual product/market fit required creating a sales team, enunciating our security stance, aligning our processes with the finance departments of our customers, and so on.

I still vividly remember the first time we "closed" a deal with a big company. We had gotten all the approvals, legal signoff, crossed all the T's. We even had a signature on the order form! The money was as good as in-the-bank. There was just this formality, they told us; the next step was to talk to someone in the procurement department. No big deal, it sounded like we were just talking to finance in the usual way, figuring out who could issue the purchase order and giving them the bank wiring details. Maybe a little different title, sure, but every company's different. NO. This time it was different. The person we talked to put us through a first-rate sausage grinder and renegotiated the entire deal from scratch. It didn't close. He put the hammer down on pricing and killed everything, refusing to let the company buy what dozens of people had worked hard to bring into their team for months. What the actual!?!?!

This was the first company we'd sold to who had a purchasing department. As I was about to learn, big companies put these into place at some point because they know their employees are going to want to purchase lots of products. And there's no chance all of their thousands of employees are going to negotiate good deals. It makes total sense: how many DBAs and developers have the training and temperament to get a good deal when they're across the table from a salesperson with decades of experience? They'll get eaten for lunch. So companies put in gatekeepers _and give them commissions based on how much they're able to browbeat vendors_. These people can be absolute bulldogs. The definition of their job is to get the vendor on their knees begging.

"It's the end of the quarter and you've been using our service on hundreds of servers for 6 months already! Pleeeeease!!!"  <br>

_OUT OF OFFICE: RE: VividCortex Contract_ <br>

Your worst nightmare. But you know what? _This is part of product/market fit._ If you haven't built your company to sell through your customers' purchasing processes, you don't have product/market fit. In reality, this requires building _way_ more than just the app or service; that's a small fraction of the whole product---the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This is why I said [sales is a key part of a company's core IP](/blog/four-core-ip/).

### Conclusions

Product/market fit is vastly different from what I used to think when I founded VividCortex. I was really thinking about service/user fit without realizing it. Product/market fit isn't when your users are getting value from your app. It's when you sell the value you create, and your market---a set of customers with common needs and who have herd buying behavior---purchases and acquires it.

&dagger; Note: if your dating app is free, the product isn't the app.  The product is the ROI you create for your advertisers.

\* Note: A product is usually much more of a _concept_ than a set of functionality or features or whatnot; and that's why marketing is valuable.
