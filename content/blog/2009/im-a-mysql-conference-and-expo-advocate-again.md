So far this year I've been totally silent about the [MySQL Conference and Expo 2009](http://www.mysqlconf.com/). In the past I've been a vocal advocate of [going to the conference](/blog/2008/02/22/remember-to-sign-up-for-mysql-conference-and-expo/) and [sending your employees to the conference](/blog/2008/03/06/send-your-employees-to-the-mysql-conference/). So my silence was conspicuous to me, if not to you. I've always considered myself a strong MySQL supporter and I still do.

Why wasn't I telling people to go to this year's conference? Simple: I can't in good conscience tell people to attend an event from which I've been excluded ([oh, the irony](http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2009/01/12/on-open-source-and-open-competition-in-a-not-so-open-world/)). So I stayed quiet while [MySQL employees](http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-get-your-proposal-accepted-to.html) [told people](http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/09/08/call-for-papers-for-mysql-conference-call-by-22-oct-2008/) to [read my article](http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/10/08/reminder-mysql-user-conference-cfp-ends-in-two-weeks/) about [how to get a session accepted to the MySQL conference](/blog/2007/10/05/how-to-get-your-session-accepted-to-mysql-conference-2008/). More irony. It is not my way to remain silent, but circumstances demanded it.

But now I'm back! My colleagues and I will be there, and now I'm advocating for your attendance there, as ever. You should come to the conference, and you should consider attending the [Percona Performance Conference](http://conferences.percona.com/) at the same time so you can learn about more than just MySQL (and see the "missing sessions" that weren't accepted).

And for the record, I never pressured anyone to accept my sessions. I just stayed silent. That's what polite people do when they're not on the guest list: they just find another party.
