Gotta love those three-dimensional charts. They sure are shiny! Look at this:

This is a screenshot of [FusionCharts graphs](http://www.fusioncharts.com/). But wait, on closer inspection: 5 and 7 are the same height? 6 is exactly twice as tall as 2?

Pseudo-three-dimensional charts are the bane of my existence. [Tufte]({{< amz 0961392142 >}}) would definitely not approve. (If you don't have [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information]({{< amz 0961392142 >}}), you should really get it and give it a read.)
