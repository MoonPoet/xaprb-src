I'm going to present on [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/) at the [CPOSC conference](http://www.cposc.org/) in central Pennsylvania on Saturday, October 17th 2009. I'll give an overview of the toolkit, which is no longer an easy task in a single session. I see a number of other interesting sessions have been accepted. It looks like it'll be a good conference.
