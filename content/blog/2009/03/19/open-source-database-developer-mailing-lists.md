What's going on at your favorite open-source database developer mailing list? Non-scientific memory of what I've been seeing lately:

*   The [Drizzle list](https://launchpad.net/~drizzle-discuss) is talking about test coverage and completeness, and schedulers.
*   The [MySQL internals list](http://lists.mysql.com/internals) has recently been dominated with talk about coding standards.
*   The [PostgreSQL hackers list](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/) is talking about a ton of stuff. I don't even try to keep up.
*   The [Percona launchpad list](https://lists.launchpad.net/percona-discussion/) is talking about bugs, xtrabackup, and more bugs and patches for them. There's also a [Percona Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/percona-discussion) that is not very active. In fact there are several Percona lists; it looks a little confused.
