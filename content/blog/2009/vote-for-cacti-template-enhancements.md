If you'd like some improvements to the Cacti templates (MySQL, Apache, Memcached, and more) I've been maintaining, please make your voice heard---either write to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/better-cacti-templates), or post a new issue (or comment on an existing one) on the [issue list](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/issues/list). I've got a bunch of work underway, including a test suite for `ss_get_by_ssh.php`.
