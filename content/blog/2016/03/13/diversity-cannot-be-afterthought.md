title: Diversity Cannot be an Afterthought
---

This blog post is not an argument for diversity or its benefits. This is a call
to action for those who think it's too soon to prioritize diversity. If you
value diversity, you must plan for it from the start. I did---but not enough,
and I'm realizing that now.

I have many reasons for valuing diversity at my startup, VividCortex.  Diverse
teams create better outcomes, have access to a larger pool of people, and
besides, it's just the right thing to do.

I care about diversity in three major areas.

1. The overall employee base.
2. The leadership and management team.
3. The board of directors.

I have worked for and with people who don't value diversity, as well as those
who do.  I'm still learning a lot about it myself. As a white American male,
it's easy to skate through life without needing to learn about and
appreciate diversity, so to the extent I have, it's largely because of someone's
conscious efforts.

My premise for this blog post is simple: the larger and less diverse a team is,
the harder it becomes to add team members who don't "match" the existing team.
You need to build diversity in from the start, because it's hard to add later.
People who do not see themselves and their values reflected in the team will not
join.

I know this because I have been listening to peoples'
opinions of prospective employers. For example, a couple of years ago I
deliberately sought out and followed many more women on Twitter while
unfollowing men (a choice I might write about someday).  Since then I've seen
countless tweets about their reactions to being recruited. This isn't something
I'd have been conscious of a few years ago, nor would I have understood or
believed the strength of these womens' convictions had you tried to tell me.

An example, which I choose solely because it's recent and addresses the points I
care about, is Fiona Tay's reaction to Sutter Hill Ventures, a prominent Silicon
Valley venture capital firm. I don't know most of the parties involved, and
those to whom I've been introduced were brief interactions in narrowly focused
contexts.

Fiona [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MsFionaTay/status/707724214086684672)
pictures of an email exchange, along with the comment "Venture Capital continues
to believe in the mirrortocracy. #OldBoysClub" and a mention of Ellen Pao, a
former venture capitalist who
[pursued](http://recode.net/2015/09/10/ellen-pao-speaks-i-am-now-moving-on/) a
legal case against Kleiner Perkins for gender discrimination and retaliation.
Here's what Fiona wrote, presumably in reply to an email I haven't seen.

And here is how the recruiter replied to her.

Reactions to Fiona were strongly supportive.  And it should be obvious why!
Besides the tone-deaf reply from Zack, here are pictures of the most influential
and powerful members of the Sutter Hill team---the managing directors and the
partners.

Full disclosure, I omitted 4 entrepreneurs in residence and designers in
residence, who are more diverse but don't have the power this group has.  Zack's
own picture on LinkedIn looks like a white male in his 20s.

The reality is stark. Most women will react the way Fiona did. I've seen it
again and again. I know this is obvious to women, but as a man I know
first hand that a lot of men will be surprised by that. Companies whose teams
look like Sutter Hill's have a serious chicken-and-egg problem to solve. They're
painted into a corner.  Mostly-white, mostly-male, or mostly-both is a dead end,
especially if it exists at the leadership level.

At some point, which I now believe is alarmingly early and small, it becomes
difficult enough to solve that the outcome is almost certain: the company will
not be significantly diverse, ever.  This theory is easy to validate,
anecdotally, by looking at the paroxysms of big companies who are trying hard to
diversify. Most of them are not making progress that impresses the people they
want to bring on board.

Now comes the part where I say what I'm trying to do about this, right? Walk the
walk?

Zack's response to Fiona was an arrogant claim to taking the high road, tossing
out "values" as a buzzword. Although Zack's appeal to values revealed his
ignorance of them, values have always mattered to me. Since I first read *The 7
Habits of Highly Effective People* around the year 2000, I have had a personal
mission statement and values statement.

That's why I worked from the beginning to identify and codify the values I
thought I brought to VividCortex. Those are "The Golden Rule," "Mutual
Improvement," and "Work Lean," followed by "diversity, humor, humility, honesty,
frugality, focus, fitness, sharing, and listening." Those are quotes from the
employee handbook I wrote. I'll say more about this later.

And even before I founded VividCortex in 2012, I knew I wanted it to be diverse
to the best of my then-current knowledge and ability. I made lists of women who
might be good board members, for example.

That's my segue into one of the things that's brought this topic to the
forefront for me, out of the noise of the dozens of urgent things I deal with
each week. I currently have a two-member board: me and another white man who
represents my major investor. I have a single vacant seat now, and I need to
fill it.

Adding someone to your board is serious.  If you haven't been a CEO, here's a
quick summary of the gravity of choosing board members. The board of directors
is one of the most important teams in the company, because they provide the
structure and leadership for the leaders themselves.  The board members need to
be chosen carefully for what they can contribute to the company's success, and
they need to contribute a *lot*. When you appoint a member, you should regard it
as essentially permanent.  If this is something you're interested in, I suggest
reading *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team* and *Startup Boards*.

Faced with this decision, diversity could seem like a cost without a benefit.
Why would you try to find a woman, for example, if you have easy access to
people who are well qualified for the roles, and whom you already know, which
reduces the risk significantly---but who all happen to be men?  Why would you
try to find a woman with the required abilities and experience and connections
when, relative to men, there are so few to choose from? Why would you
deliberately limit your search to a fraction of the candidate pool?  If you want
to add a woman to your board, the nature of the search could change so much that
you could be accused of using diversity as the *sole* criterion.  (I haven't
been accused of that.) Regardless of perceptions, if you *were* to use that as
the sole criterion, being a board member is such a high-leverage role that it
could be an extremely bad decision for the company.

With that in context, why would you say in effect "I want to have at least one
non-white-male board member?"

The questions and the statement themselves point out the absurdity and gravity
of the "isms" (sexism, racism...) that exist in our culture. One way to see this
clearly is to phrase it in reverse, as
[@ManWhoHasItAll](https://twitter.com/manwhohasitall) often does. The result
might be, for example:

> "I absolutely insist on having at least one white male on our board
> of directors." - Claire, CEO and Founder.

Claire, choose directors by the right criteria! Claire, choose your battles and
don't lower the bar!  Claire, what do you think you will gain from this
pointless effort? Claire, that might be a pyrrhic victory!

Of course, part of the reason the search for highly qualified female board
members is hard is because of the factors I point out in this article. In short,
we're a blatantly sexist culture that
[disproportionately](https://www.google.com/search?q=women+can%27t+raise+venture+capital)
puts white men in positions (such as being founders) that are board-qualifying
experiences in the first place. In other words, venture capital groups that are
composed of white males are part of the reason the cycle perpetuates.

Beyond the board, diversity matters most when a company begins to scale. I
listed my values above, which I unabashedly imposed upon VividCortex. What I
didn't say was that I thought the first three were *core* values without which
the company could not survive or excel, and the rest were *aspirational* values
that I wanted to achieve, but would not be deadly to the company if not, no
matter how badly I'd feel about that. Now that we're beginning to scale, I'm
reconsidering that judgment. I'm beginning to believe that diversity truly is a
core value necessary to achieving excellence---one that took me several years to
understand.

There are many challenges to building a diverse team.  In the face of these
challenges and the consequences of making the wrong calls, the arguments for
the known status quo can seem pretty compelling and rational.

But none of them changes the harsh reality: once you build a club, changing
who's in it comes slowly if at all.
