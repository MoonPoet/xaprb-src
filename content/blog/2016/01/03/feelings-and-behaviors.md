title: Feelings and Behaviors
---

It's a new year and I drew a diagram that sums up much of what I've learned from
various mentors over the last few decades.

This diagram probably means something different to everyone
who reads it, but here's what it means to me:

- I can choose where I direct my attention. Where I direct it is a reflection of
  what I really value, regardless of what I claim to value.
- If there's a spectrum of paying attention to and valuing my feelings, at one
  extreme, and other peoples' feelings at the other extreme; and a similar
  spectrum between observing and learning from my actions and their
  consequences, versus noticing what others do and what results; then I can draw
  four quadrants.
- These four quadrants may have lots of nuances, but in the most simplistic
  sense, the healthier people I know tend to care about their own actions and
  other peoples' feelings. They don't keep their attention statically fixed
  there; rather, they move fluidly between external and internal observation and
  reasoning, balancing all things. This virtuous cycle is a dynamic dance of
  loving, generous relationships in the top right quadrant.
- I used to live bottom-left. I saw myself as a helpless victim, against whom
  the universe and world constantly plotted, and who "couldn't get a break from
  bad luck." I was caught in a vicious cycle of noticing how I felt and blaming
  my feelings on what other people had "done to" me. When I was stuck in this
  quadrant, I modulated these behaviors only enough to poke my head out of my
  hole and confirm my suspicions that I was just a casualty of "the system" and
  the deck was all stacked against me.
- The other two quadrants are less pathological, but don't tend to be positions
  of equilibrium. Whether a person ends up top-right or bottom-left is a product
  of many different possible circumstances, in my experience (N=1).

Now, what about the new year?

It's a New Year and I'm continually inspired by the people around me who live
more in the top right quadrant. I hover around in that quadrant sometimes.
Sometimes I slip lower left. Sometimes I retreat into lower right. Sometimes I
forget who I am and move into the upper left, where I give more weight to
others' esteem of me than my own.

I used to live in the lower left. I experience fewer moments of that old
behavior every New Year than I did the year before. This is usually because of
the choices I make--much less so than random events or other peoples' actions.

To the extent that I move upwards and rightwards this year, I know I will be the
better for it.
