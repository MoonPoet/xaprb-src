If you follow this site via RSS or social media, you might be interested to know that there's also an email newsletter.
Once a week, a digest of all my new posts (if any) get auto-emailed to all subscribers.
I've had the newsletter for a while and have lots of subscribers, but only today did it occur to me that announcing it in a blog post would be a good idea.

Like many people, I learned how to create a newsletter by reading [Julia Evans's blog post about it](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/12/28/making-a-weekly-newsletter/).
Thanks, Julia!
I didn't do much differently from her newsletter; why reinvent what works?
My biggest innovation was to build it into my Hugo static site generator theme, [Story](https://story.xaprb.com/), which is open-source.
In that way, not only did I add a newsletter to my site, but I hopefully made it super-easy for many others to do so on their own sites too.
