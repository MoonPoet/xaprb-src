If yours is a data-driven organization, your DBAs probably face significant challenges to executing effectively. These typically include the following:
<!--more-->

* The scale and growth of the data. You know that data is big and growing fast, but you might not realize that DBAs are often expected to handle it with the same resources. In other words, the data-to-human ratio is growing rapidly.
* Emerging technologies, which often lack the mature tools DBAs rely on for productivity.
* The [diversity and complexity](https://vividcortex.com/blog/2015/01/23/polyglot-persistence-distributed-database-new-reality/) of databases and application architectures, which means that DBAs can't manage a single set of technologies with a single set of tools. And modern applications are almost always distributed with clustering and replication across large numbers of machines.
* Distributed and outsourced team structures. The pressures of working with remote teams challenge a DBA's schedule, add friction to interpersonal communications, and complicate office politics.

Because organizations usually view IT, and thus DBAs, as a cost center, outsourcing and "taking away parts of the job" is seen as a smart decision, but can backfire. The truth is that as long as companies own their data, they need to own the management of it too, at least in large part. This is because the DBA role is a critical interface between vital IT teams, and seeking to minimize or eliminate this role can be counter-productive.

DBAs, in fact, can end up being the canaries in the coal mine for IT as a whole. But when the canary is dying, instead of recognizing that there's an environmental problem, the instinctive response is sometimes "get the canary out of here!"

Here are some of the reasons that trouble with DBAs should be seen as a symptom, rather than a cause, of overall IT dysfunction:

* Failure to recognize their strategic importance means they aren't being hired, trained, and managed correctly.
* They occupy multiple positions of handoff, interaction, and information sharing between different teams.
* Their duties and knowledge are specialized, leading to a temptation to centralize the burden on them instead of sharing or offloading it.

These problems lead to DBAs becoming a bottleneck for all of IT, and therefore for the entire company. I've seen it again and again. It's straight out of *The Phoenix Project* or *The Goal*.

If any of this rings true for you, [my latest ebook might be helpful](https://vividcortex.com/resources/building-scalable-dba-team/). It's 44 pages of everything I've learned about building teams of people who are great at managing data over the past decade.
