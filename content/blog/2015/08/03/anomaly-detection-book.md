**UPDATE:** the book is now available from
[https://ruxit.com/anomaly-detection/](https://ruxit.com/anomaly-detection/).

Together with [Preetam Jinka](http://preet.am/), I'm writing a book for O'Reilly
called *Anomaly Detection for Monitoring* (working title).

I'd like your help with this. Would you please comment,
[tweet](https://twitter.com/xaprb), or [email](mailto:baron@xaprb.com) me
examples of anomaly detection used for monitoring; and monitoring problems that
frustrate you, which you think anomaly detection might help solve?

Thanks in advance.
