Together with [Preetam Jinka](http://preet.am/), I wrote a book for O'Reilly
called [Anomaly Detection for
Monitoring](http://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/anomaly-detection-monitoring.csp).

The book contains great examples of anomaly detection used for monitoring. It's
practical and simple, and contains no hype.
