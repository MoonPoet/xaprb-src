If you haven't heard about [PGConfSV](http://www.pgconfsv.com/) yet, it's a
conference for the Silicon Valley PostgreSQL community and beyond, featuring
leading PostgreSQL performance and scalability experts. It's happening November
17-18 at the South San Francisco Conference Center. I encourage everyone in the
area to attend, since this is likely to be the best Postgres conference held
thus far in the Silicon Valley.

I also urge you to [buy your tickets](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgconf-silicon-valley-2015-tickets-16521286613) before they sell out! Of course, the earlier
you buy, the more you save, too. (Use SeeMeSpeak for a 20% discount).

I'll be at the conference along with some of my colleagues. I'm pretty excited
about this for a few reasons. Allow me to 'splain why?


<!--more-->

First, [I've loved PostgreSQL for a long
time](/blog/2008/04/01/postgresql-conference-east-2008/) although fate has
mostly seen me work in the MySQL community. I've attended, spoken, helped
organize and otherwise been involved in a handful of Postgres events, and this
conference brings back a lot of good memories and anticipation. Among other
things, Terry Erisman is one of the principal organizers and he does a
*fantastic* job of overseeing conferences. Seriously. He's one of the big
reasons the MySQL conference not only continued, but rebounded after the dark
days of the Sun acquisition. PostgreSQL fans should be thrilled to have him
involved.

Secondly, [VividCortex](https://www.vividcortex.com/) is a sponsor, so I'll be
there in an official capacity.

Finally, I'm
[speaking](http://www.pgconfsv.com/sessions/analyzing-postgresql-network-traffic-vc-pgsql-sniffer)
about sniffing the network protocol off the wire and analyzing it. If you've
seen any of my talks about "finding hidden treasures in TCP traffic" kinds of
topics, hopefully you'll have an idea of what might be in store in that talk.

I also participated in an
[interview](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/25-terry/261-pgconf-silicon-valley-speaker-baron-schwartz-vividcortex-%E2%80%8E)
leading up to the conference, on why I'm so excited not only about this
particular event, but also why I'm more and more excited about PostgreSQL in
general. As a community and as a technology, it's really exploding onto the
scene in ways a lot of people don't appreciate yet. (But they will!)

Come be a part of the next big sea change in opensource relational databases!
