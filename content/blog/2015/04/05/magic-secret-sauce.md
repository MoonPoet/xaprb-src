title: Beware Of The Only Correct Way To Do It
description: "Beware of blog posts warning you to beware of things, too."
---

Everyone who's been successful at creating something remarkable, and scaling it,
likely has developed into a repeatable process. If they hadn't, they wouldn't
have scaled it, and you'd never have heard of it. (There are lots of geniuses
you've never heard of who've created remarkable results at an individual level.)

A lot of times they'll go through several iterations of massive success with
this, then write some books, found a consulting company, go on the speaking
circuit, and so on. And almost always, they seem to demand rigid adherence to
specific sacred-cow principles that must remain inviolate.

You should be really skeptical of anything that smells like this. Sacred cows
make the best steaks, and here's why.

No, not the mugs, the mugs aren't why you should be skeptical. But let's talk
about how this usually plays out by looking at a couple of places I've seen
adamant insistence on the one true gospel.  I'll use real examples from some
things I'm currently working on in my business right now.

### Case #1: SalesForce and Cold Calling 2.0

Aaron Ross has a bestselling book called [Predictable
Revenue](http://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213/?tag=xaprb-20) in which he
declares the death and obsolescence of salespeople making cold calls.

> I define a cold call as "calling someone who doesn't know you and isn't
> expecting your call." (page 24).

Aaron espouses Cold Calling 2.0, which is a different method of prospecting for
sales: "prospecting into cold accounts without ever making any cold calls."
(page 24). He returns to this point again and again through the book: never,
ever make any cold calls. Ever again. Ever.

Aaron claims that this worked incredibly well and is the way the entire
SalesForce team was trained and scaled.

I don't doubt that they use Cold Calling 2.0 at SalesForce.

But my experience with SalesForce as a CEO/founder of a tech company does
not match with what Aaron says they did. After we closed our first round of
funding, my cofounder and I were spammed with cold calls from SalesForce.
There is no other way to put it. They badgered us mercilessly. *Mercilessly.*
Aaron talks about sales development reps being "pleasantly persistent." I am not
proud to say I eventually yelled obscenities into the phone at the sales rep who
would not take no for an answer. As a rule I do not curse at people and it is
very rare for me to lose my cool, maybe only happens once every couple of years.
*He cold called me and would not stop calling back every few days even after I,
the CEO of the company, had asked him to stop and told him the answer was no at
least several times.*

Not only that but he called my cofounder as well. And emailed both of us. It was
infuriating. No means no!

This was a while ago and I am sure my memory has become inaccurate. I bet they
have records, though, of every interaction. I would be happy to hear that I'm
remembering this wrong. SalesForce, if you'd like to correct me, please look
up Zach E's interactions with me and let me know if I'm misinterpreting.

### Case #2: HubSpot and Permission-Based / Inbound Marketing

HubSpot's methodology is [inbound
marketing](http://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing). The idea is that you attract
people and companies to you by providing them with helpful, relevant
content. Blogs, webinars, etc. Really valuable stuff. By doing this, you
help them be successful with or without you, but you also ask them to
identify themselves (two-way street). You make people aware that in addition to all
the stuff they can do on their own with the free content and resources you
provide, you also provide services/products/whatever that will amplify their
success.

So in HubSpot's case, for example, their blog helps people understand how to do
marketing that turns strangers into ravingly happy customers. Not just
customers---promoters, who can't stop themselves from saying how awesome your
product or service is. And thus, by doing this "marketing that people will
love," you make everyone aware of your products/services and how valuable they
are, and magnetically attract customers to yourself. You turn a "pushy" outbound
sales/marketing process into a "magnetic pull" of inbound attraction.

And HubSpot also strongly condemns cold-calling, pushy sales tactics... they
recommend [permission-based
marketing](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30718/15-Tenets-of-Proper-Email-Marketing-Etiquette.aspx)
instead. They talk about the very real dangers of legal repercussions, domain
blacklisting and spam database scoring, and so on.

My experience with HubSpot?

*Spammed.* Mercilessly spammed. Katie C emailed me. She sent me LinkedIn requests
and messages. She tweeted to me. I can't remember if she called me. I think she
did. I know for sure that she found and pushed messages to every possible
channel you could reach me by. Well, probably not text messages, come to think
of it. But this went on, and on, and on. I did not respond; I decided to try
silence instead of "no," because I'd been spammed out of my mind by people who
wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

Did I find HubSpot's outbound sales efforts to be permission-based? No,
I did not. There were no required CAN-SPAM opt-out links. I had no prior contact
with them; I'm sure they bought my name and contact information from a list like
all the other spammers did. Did I fall in love with their tactics? No, I did
not. Had I earned their attention by browsing their site? No. I had never heard
of them before (and frankly the first impression I got was really poor.)

After Katie C eventually stopped (after sending an increasingly ridiculous,
over-the-top series of "breakup" messages, sobbing about how I didn't love her
anymore), I finally got some peace for a while. Then Andrew F started up.

I'd had enough and I reported it to SalesForce's abuse department, because they
were sending these non-compliant emails from SalesForce.

### I'm a SalesForce and HubSpot Customer

Here's the thing. At VividCortex we are customers of *both* companies. I
recognize the value of what they provide, and I knew about their offerings.
Before I even founded the company I knew we'd use SalesForce. We used Act-On
for marketing automation for a while, but recently switched (the reasons why are
another interesting story) to HubSpot.

We aren't customers because of their obnoxious tactics, but *despite* them.

### Why Do They Do It?

If Cold Calling 2.0 and Inbound Marketing are the bees' knees, and create
incredible results, and are sacred cows you should absolutely adhere to, then
why do these two extremely valuable service providers not follow their own
advice?

Because one size doesn't fit all. Cold calling *does* work for some people
(generally not for me, though there are exceptions). Finding a CEO/founder's
contact information after a funding round, and pestering the hell out of him/her
about lead generation on every possible social network and communications
channel, *does* work in some cases.

These companies are not satisfied with the results they can obtain from
following a simple process to the letter. They know they can eke out incremental
improvements by crossing the line into the "off-limits" areas.

### That's Why You Should Be Skeptical

That's why you should be skeptical of anyone's magic secret sauce. The more they
insist there is a bedrock principle (or three) that you must absolutely believe
in, no shades of gray---the more you should be skeptical.

Going through the sales process with HubSpot, in particular, was like the
twilight zone. Their sales team was making it sound like HubSpot itself
generates all of their revenue completely from inbound marketing.

The hypocrisy makes it hard to believe *anything* they say. Everything becomes
too good to be true.  It's really weird, because there's cognitive dissonance
everywhere.

What do I mean by that? It's pretty simple---I know and I believe in the value
of inbound marketing.  It *works.* I've not only seen it done, but I've done it
myself, and the results were incredible. At a previous employer, you practically
could not do a Google search for a related keyword without my content appearing
in the first page of results, and usually the first several links. When we
hooked that up to a marketing automation system, all the numbers went through
the roof.

It worked at that company, and it's working shockingly well at VividCortex too.

That's why I knew I needed inbound marketing and marketing automation. I knew I
needed Marketo, Act-On, HubSpot, or another vendor. I didn't know which one I
wanted to use---I'd used Marketo before and wanted to see if I could find
something a little better---but I knew one of these kinds of companies would be
absolutely vital.

So when HubSpot was telling us how insanely good the results would be from doing
"pure" inbound marketing, and I knew that they were simultaneously telling the
truth and also did not adhere to that advice themselves, I had to get off the
phone with them and talk with the team about what we'd just heard. What was real
and what was hype?

This is a vitally important exercise anytime someone shows you a
method/process/practice that's the one true way.

This holds for things I write and say, too. I say disciplined database
performance optimization depends on measuring the workload the systems handle,
and without it you're just doing trial-and-error. I say a low-sugar, high-fat,
minimally-processed diet can transform your body. I say a lot of things to try
to teach and explain what I've discovered to work well.

But if you ever catch me insisting there are no exceptions, call me out on it.
Sometimes cache hit ratios work to tune databases. Sometimes I like to eat ice
cream. Life's not supposed to be black and white.

Sacred cows make the best steaks.
