> We're excited to share that VividCortex is now part of the SolarWinds family. We believe this change will help to accelerate the adoption of our product as well as the pace of our product development. This, in turn, will result in us serving more customers and better realizing our vision of making every engineer awesome at databases.

> We think SolarWinds and VividCortex are a great match. We've been developing a relationship with SolarWinds for nearly five years, and both teams have gotten to know each other well. There's strong strategic and business alignment between our companies, ranging from the types of customers we serve to our sales and engineering cultures. Significantly, SolarWinds has expressed personal warmth and goodwill, as well as confidence in our business from the start.

> We're very proud of what the VividCortex team has accomplished. Most startups don't make it---but we've not only survived, we've thrived. In the past couple of years, we have accelerated our growth significantly due to our ability to execute, the unique strengths of our product, and the lack of other products that can meet our customers' demanding needs. We've built a truly impressive team, product, and customer base---and as a result, this union is a resounding success for everyone. That includes not only investors and employees, but we feel strongly it's going to be very beneficial for our customers and for the communities where VividCortex has been welcomed. We're especially proud to be a part of the growing entrepreneurial ecosystem in our hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia!

> We'd like to give a special shout-out to all the people who've been there with us, whether on the field or in the stands cheering us on: team members, customers, investors, advisors, friends, family members, bankers, lawyers, recruiters, and even competitors. (We're probably omitting some folks!) We're truly all in this together and we couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, from all of us to all of you.

> Best wishes for the holidays, and here's to a new year filled with new and exciting possibilities!

> Warmly, Baron and Amena
