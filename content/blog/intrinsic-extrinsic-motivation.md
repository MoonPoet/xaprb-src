I've learned valuable lessons about managing and motivating by reflecting on how I responded to and resisted my father's parenting.
My father used to keep a note in the pocket of his blue work shirt, with two columns: one of plus signs, one of minuses.
He used the columns to score my behavior and determine whether I had earned privileges and rewards.
This did not have the intended effect.

<!--more-->

I had a long history of tension with my father over unfair discipline, but I put aside my misgivings and tried hard to make it work.
As I expected, it was immediately obvious that my father's scoring would be imbalanced.
A negative mark was easy to gain and difficult to prevent, and some days I received many of them.
If my spoon made a noise against my teeth, I got a negative.
If I looked unhappy about that, I got another; if I protested, yet another.
I couldn't avoid negatives, no matter how hard I tried.

I could offset the negatives by earning positives, so I worked hard, volunteering for chores and going above and beyond.
But my father didn't notice, because he was scrutinizing me for imperfections.
I tried asking for a plus sign, but he gave me a minus for asking, *&agrave; la* Oliver Twist.

The minuses accumulated quickly: the column reached the bottom of the page and he started another next to it, and then another.
After many weeks, I had only a few pluses in the good column.
I don't remember what I had to do to earn them, which feels significant to me now.
I remember I once did the dishes for my family of six, and my mother noticed and said I deserved a plus sign.
My father demurred: plus signs were rewards for *special* efforts.
My mother fought with him, pointing out the asymmetry, but he was unmoved.

I'd been cooperating sincerely in the spirit of giving the system a chance and my father the benefit of the doubt, but that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
It was clear that the deck was stacked against me.
No matter how hard I tried, playing by the rules would get me nowhere, and I had no hope of gaining the advantage I'd earned through good behavior.
So I rebelled openly against the scoring system.
This escalated swiftly into severe punishment, but I bore the pain stubbornly and continued to protest the injustice.

This particular episode of madness wasn't my father's only attempt to figure out how to control me.
He tried many different approaches, all of them fundamentally flawed.
He tried beating me into submission, taking away or destroying my belongings, and revoking every single privilege including the privilege to speak or be spoken to.
He tried locking me out in the dead of winter without shoes or a coat, and he tried starvation.
He seemingly tried everything he could think of.
He told me once that severe and frequent beating was the only approach that worked for me, and he placed the blame on me, not himself.
(I don't remember it working. I only remember reading books on interrogation and torture so I could learn how to withstand greater pain.)

It went in cycles, and the pattern was always the same.
He'd explain the new rules of engagement to me, I'd suspend my doubts and work hard to comply, he'd prove that the only real rule was that I had to lose, I'd object almost without regard for the personal consequences, and life would be hellish until my mother convinced him to try a different approach.
My parents' marriage was also deeply troubled, and this pattern certainly contributed to their eventual separation and divorce.

Recently I've been thinking again about the notebook with pluses and minuses, and made some progress on understanding better how I responded to my father.
A few of the interesting questions are: why did I initially cooperate, despite all the history that showed it would turn out the same?
Why did I fight so hard in the face of the terrible consequences when I gave up on cooperation; why didn't I yield to make it easier on myself?
Why did more severe punishments make me more determined not to surrender?
Why did he think his systems of rewards and punishments would work in the first place?

What I've realized is that most of my motivation is intrinsic, not extrinsic; and that a firm alignment with truth is the psychological anchor that helps me ride out all the emotional storms of life.

I think my father thought I'd respond to and be motivated by external factors---things like rewards and punishments.
I doubt he thought I'd be motivated much by how I felt about myself and my own decisions and actions.
And that's the issue: this assumption is exactly backwards for me.
I'm not very motivated by rewards or punishments, I don't think I ever have been, and I probably never will be.
You generally can't make much progress with me by offering me external incentives, either positive or negative: promising me rewards, bribing me, shaming me, withholding, threats, and so on.
In fact, external incentives can be profoundly counterproductive, making me much less likely to comply.
At the same time, I'm highly motivated by internal factors.
That's why it was so important for me to try so hard to work within my father's systems of discipline, and to be willing to let it begin with me; I had to give him the benefit of recognizing that he was trying, and offer the help I could.
Only after a good-faith effort to make it work could I quit in good faith, and having a clear conscience is a huge motivator for me.

The other big factor was the importance of right and wrong and a correct understanding of reality.
As far back as I can remember, I've had a strong sense that justice and truth matter more than a meal or avoiding a beating.
And to mouth words I don't believe, and act out behaviors I disagree with, would violate my worldview and divide me against myself.
My brothers and mother urged me to put things into perspective and stop making life needlessly hard on myself.
But I would not consent to injustice because it would mean agreeing that wrong was right, and I sensed it would have consequences for my mental health.[^mental]
It was just *wrong*, and it was important to be clear on that point.

My brothers handled the conflicts with my father differently and perhaps more skillfully.
We all were wounded; it's impossible not to be in a situation like ours.
But we all have recovered in our own ways, and for me, knowing that I held true to my North Star has been an important part of my own journey out of that suffering.
The bruises lasted for days, but the mental and emotional scars are still there decades later, which is perhaps another way of saying that taking a beating for the truth might have been the right choice for me.

These experiences have been formative for me, as you've probably guessed.
As terrible as my relationship with my father was, I have turned some of those grains of sand into pearls.
Today I can be grateful for outcomes such as an ardent desire to develop relationship skills he lacked; empathy for how terrible it is to be criticized constantly; faith in my ability to be disciplined under duress; and a deep conviction that the value I place on fairness is merited.
I also learned that choosing to respond instead of react is true, inalienable freedom.

You can see these influences everywhere in my life if you know where to look.
For example, one of the four Core Values of VividCortex is empathy, which I [contrast](/blog/better-than-the-golden-rule/) with the Golden Rule.[^goldenrule]
What makes work fun for *me* is [growth, impact, and great people](/blog/three-keys-rewarding-career-challenge-impact-people/), but perhaps someone else is more focused on money or security.
There's no fundamental conflict in this difference, but companies do best when they're composed of people whose values are at least compatible, if not shared.
And because I recognize that not everyone values the same things I do, I try to be careful not to assume.

Reflecting again recently on my father, and how I tried to work with him and then fought him, has reinforced to me the importance of knowing what drives me.
It seems to me that most social contracts make little effort to offer anything beyond extrinsic motivators.
Standard legal and HR practices encode these assumptions tightly: stock options are a "retention" mechanism, a payout for a confidentiality and nondisparagement agreement is the "consideration" that makes it binding, and so forth.
The assumption is that people are uniformly motivated, and that rewards and punishments have some constant value for all people.

But for me---and perhaps I'm unusual in this regard, I have no way of judging at the moment---this isn't the case.
Things that are meant to motivate can demotivate me; tactics meant to make me stay might make me want to leave, and so on.
I can examine wide swaths of my life and see this effect in many places.
It's not just my father's punishments; I'm thinking about a romantic relationship I left because she tried to get me to stay, for example.

I think a big part of it for me is the sense that reducing things to transactions makes them profane, and I yearn for the sacred.
I want to do things for their own sake; for me, sacred means reduction to the essence of the thing itself.
Not only that, but I want to *want* to do things for their own sake, meaning that I aspire to the simplicity of pure doing.

This is deeply bound to my worldview; there is no work/life separation for me.
As Shunryu Suzuki said:

> People ask what it means to practice zazen with no gaining idea, what kind of effort is necessary for that kind of practice. The answer is: effort to get rid of something extra from our practice. If some extra idea comes, you should try to stop it; you should remain in pure practice. That is the point towards which our effort is directed.[^zenmind]

My constant effort is to desire nothing extra.
In that light, something extra offered detracts from the experience of the work itself.
Imagine if I wanted to buy a premium expensive espresso shot, and you offered a bad one instead, cheap, compensated by adding a lot of sugar.
What a terrible bargain!
I'm reminded, too, of Krishna's admonition to Arjuna:

> The wise man lets go of all \
> results, whether good or bad, \
> and is focused on the action alone. \
> Yoga is skill in action.[^gita]

I could go on quoting the literature that inspires and informs me---Thich Nhat Hanh, Jesus, Rumi, the *Tao Te Ching*---but hopefully the point is clear.
I'm happiest when I'm satisfying my intrinsic motivations, when I'm doing right action for its own sake, when I'm detached from the outcome.
And to do this, I need to know that I'm acting in good faith, that I'll always look back on what I've done with a clear conscience and a true heart.
Finally, I seek always to peel away layers of perception and judgment and mental formations, and experience reality as directly as I can.
This, especially, makes it vitally important that I not be divided against myself in any way.

[^mental]: Today, I believe this conviction is supported by an important teaching of Buddhism: seeing the true nature of things is essential to wellbeing.
[^goldenrule]: Imagine how much more successful my father might have been, had he been empathetic enough to understand what was driving my frustratingly stubborn resistance to his disciplinary systems.
