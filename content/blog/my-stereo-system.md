If you've been reading this blog for a while, you probably know that I like to be pretty minimalistic and don't accumulate a lot of "stuff" in my life, yet there are a few things I love and value, and sometimes that involves being slightly materialistic. For those things, I try to find the sweet spot: quality above average, [price no higher than needed](/blog/2014/01/16/bose-sennheiser-sony-noise-cancelling-headphones/).

Music is one of the things I love: I have bought thousands of CDs. But I also value when my music [sounds as good as possible](/blog/2016/02/21/best-itunes-mp3-format/). About a year ago, I treated myself to an upgraded stereo system so I'd enjoy better audio quality. Here's my current system.

It's quite simple: it's designed to listen to stereo audio with as little processing and as few components as possible, but still be convenient. Here's the full list of components and widgets:

*   [ELAC B6 Debut Series 6.5" Bookshelf Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014GSEQ06/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [SANUS BF31-B1 31-Inch Bookshelf Speaker Stands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JQ5O/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [Cambridge Audio Azur 351A Integrated Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q666G1E/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [APC 550VA UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector](https://www.amazon.com/APC-Back-UPS-Battery-Protector-BE550G/dp/B0019804U8/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [AirPort Express device for AirPlay](http://www.apple.com/airport-express/)
*   iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, or another audio source
*   A couple of adapters and some speaker wire

I bought a couple of the items from Amazon Warehouse Deals and spent less than $700 on the whole setup. I cannibalized an old rubber doormat, cut in half, for padding under the speaker stands, to keep them stable and avoid vibrations.

How does it sound? It's entry-level audiophile, but definitely audiophile. For my purposes, it (expletive omitted) rocks.

The speakers are by far the most important part of the setup. Read anywhere online and you'll hear all the audiophiles raving about the ELAC speakers. They outperform speakers many times the cost. There's [a newer generation of ELACs](https://www.amazon.com/ELAC-Uni-fi-Bookshelf-Speaker-Black/dp/B01CRYWVG2/?tag=xaprb-20) that are supposed to be even better, for a small uptick in price. A reasonable upgrade for this setup would also be an ELAC subwoofer.

The amplifier is a now-discontinued generation from Cambridge Audio. If I wanted to step this up and spend a few hundred dollars more, ELAC's amplifiers are a great combination of price and value. I wanted to be slightly above bare-bones but have plenty of horsepower to drive through dynamic peaks and top-quality components. (Cambridge Audio is an audiophile brand with a near-legendary reputation.)

The speaker stands are serviceable, nothing fancy, but they place the speakers at the right height and they don't cause issues with sound quality. The rest of the components are things I already had: some headphone-to-coax adapters, 14-gauge speaker wire, and so on.

_Maybe I should pause and reveal my audiophile credentials briefly. I learned to appreciate fine audio from an uncle who's made his living designing custom systems for billionaires for decades. I used to design and build speaker enclosures myself. I've listened to music on systems costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. I remember one person who had a record needle (not including the cartridge) that cost more than ten thousand dollars. I'm not bragging about this. I consider these people certifiably insane. Imagine what you could do to help people with this kind of money, and they were wasting it on imaginary sound improvements from CD transports with green spray paint on all of the interior components, because someone told them it totally made a difference. Rubbish! The speaker wire they spent $300/foot on is literally indistinguishable, in blind tests, from coat-hanger wire._

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll reveal the ultimate blasphemy: I mostly listen to my music from an iPhone or iPad over AirPlay via an Apple AirPort Express. Ghastly, I know! I do penance for my sins every time I listen to a gorgeous song that sounds gorgeous despite the fact it's over (sniff) inferior components and comes from a file that has lossy compression.

The reality is it sounds _amazing_. Yeah, on some occasions I've pushed the limits and realized that if I'd spent a mere tens of thousands of dollars more on my stereo, that one passage in that one song could have sounded better. But! _I built a system for a few hundred dollars that sounds incredible, and rests on a foundation of an old half-rotten rubber Welcome Mat._ If I want to hear my music on a better system, I can damn well visit my uncle. I haven't seen him in too long anyway. At the rate we're going, we'll both be deaf by the time I do, and none of this will matter anyway.

Pro tip: if, like me, you're an Apple user willing to sell your soul and listen via AirPlay for the convenience, you can Option-Click on your speaker icon in your Mac's menu bar and select an AirPlay device for audio output.

Want to listen to some music that's awesome on a mid-high-end system like mine? Here's a Spotify playlist just for you. Make sure you toggle high-quality playback in your Spotify preferences. Enjoy!
