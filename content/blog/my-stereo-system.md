You probably know that I like to be pretty minimalistic, and don't accumulate a lot of "stuff" in my life. Yet for the few material things I value, I try to find the best balance of cost and quality. I enjoy music a lot, so I treated myself to an upgraded stereo system.

I chose my components for the best combination of price, convenience, and quality. Here's the full list of components and widgets:

*   [ELAC B6 Debut Series 6.5" Bookshelf Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014GSEQ06/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [Cambridge Audio Azur 351A Integrated Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q666G1E/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [SANUS BF31-B1 31-Inch Bookshelf Speaker Stands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JQ5O/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [APC 550VA UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector](https://www.amazon.com/APC-Back-UPS-Battery-Protector-BE550G/dp/B0019804U8/?tag=xaprb-20)
*   [AirPort Express device for AirPlay](http://www.apple.com/airport-express/)
*   iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, or another audio source
*   A couple of adapters and some speaker wire

I bought some of the items refurbished, and cut an old rubber doormat in half for padding under the speaker stands. I experimented with some other components, which I've listed later.

How does it sound? It's entry- to mid-level audiophile, well above average performance on a small budget. For my purposes, it's great: it fills a medium-sized room with reasonably accurate, uncolored sound.

The speakers are by far the most important part of the setup. Read anywhere online and you'll see [all the audiophiles raving about the ELAC speakers](https://www.stereophile.com/content/elac-debut-b6-loudspeaker). They outperform speakers many times the cost.

The integrated amplifier is a now-discontinued generation from Cambridge Audio. Cambridge Audio is an audiophile brand with a near-legendary reputation. I wanted it to be simple (no fancy processing), slightly above bare-bones, but have plenty of horsepower (45 watts per channel) to drive through dynamic peaks and power good-quality components. Getting a discontinued model saved me a lot of money. An integrated amplifier offers much better quality than a receiver.

The speaker stands are not fancy, but they place the speakers at the right height and they don't cause issues with sound quality. The rubber doormat keeps them stable and vibration-free.

The rest of the components are things I already had: some headphone-to-coax adapters, 14-gauge speaker wire, and so on. The UPS is important to protect the components from electrical damage.

I mostly listen to CDs, but I often use an iPhone or iPad over AirPlay via the Apple AirPort Express. Despite the theoretical problems with this, the imperfections are minor compared to the quality degradation of nearly any speakers you can buy. And the convenience makes it more fun to listen to music.

The result sounds _amazing_ on balance. Yes: if I'd spent thousands of dollars more on my stereo, that one passage in that one song could have sounded better. But! _I built a system that sounds incredible for a few hundred dollars._ If I want to hear my music on a better system, I can visit someone who owns one.

Pro tip: if, like me, you listen via AirPlay for the convenience, you can Option-Click on your speaker icon in your Mac's menu bar and select an AirPlay device for audio output.

Want to listen to some music that sounds great on a good system? Here's a Spotify playlist just for you. Make sure you toggle high-quality playback in your Spotify preferences. Enjoy!
