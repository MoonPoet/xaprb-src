I have noticed many people do not understand SQL joins, even after somewhat successfully using them for a time. Joins are key to understanding SQL. This article explains what joins really are and what they really do.

Many programmers learn SQL by writing it. I learned it by studying relational algebra under the tutelage of a theoretically-minded specialist in real-time databases. I never spoke of tables and columns; I thought in sigmas and other funny letters, and I spoke of tuples and relations. When I got a real job, I had a lot to learn about SQL in the real world, though my theoretical background helped me in some ways. I think a thorough grounding in theory is good, so I will approach this article (somewhat) from that angle.

SQL is a functional language. Try to think of a SELECT statement as a function. That is, a mathematical function, or mapping, which -- this is important -- *maps an input to an output*. When you select data from a table, think of the table as a source. Data streams out of the table. If it helps you, think of a little grinding cog icon. Then it streams out of the cog onto your screen as a familiar tabular result set. The cog is the SELECT statement, the function. It *transforms* the data. Maybe it just passes it straight through, but it really is a mapping of input to output. (By the way, if you take this approach when programming in XSLT or LISP, you will grasp things much more easily.)

A join is a SELECT statement with multiple data sources. The data streams from those sources into your cog icon, and a single stream flows out again. A SELECT statement always has one and only one output. (Why? Think of a function... think back to your math classes). Joins are functions that perform matching between data streams. The matching is necessary to merge the multiple input streams into a single output.

Let's look at two tables of data, `apples` and `oranges`.

| Variety | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Fuji    | 5.00  |
| Gala    | 6.00  |

| Variety  | Price |
|----------|-------|
| Valencia | 4.00  |
| Navel    | 5.00  |

Here is an example SELECT statement:

```sql
select apples.Variety, oranges.Price
from apples
    inner join oranges on apples.Price = oranges.Price;
```

Here is (conceptually) what happens when we join these tables:

- Choose a left-hand table (the first table in the SELECT statement).
- For each row in the right-hand table, take the entire left-hand table and stack its rows next to the row in the right-hand table.
- Fill in the missing rows in the right-hand table by duplicating them into the empty spaces.

| Variety | Price | Variety  | Price |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Fuji    | 5.00  | Valencia | 4.00  |
| Gala    | 6.00  | Valencia | 4.00  |
| Fuji    | 5.00  | Navel    | 5.00  |
| Gala    | 6.00  | Navel    | 5.00  |

The result is a large table containing the *cross-product* or *Cartesian product* of the two data sets. Now satisfy the matching criteria by applying them as a predicate to each row in this new data set. If the predicate is true for the row, include it, otherwise exclude it. The result contains a single row:

| Variety | Price | Variety  | Price |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Fuji    | 5.00  | Navel    | 5.00  |


Now choose only the desired columns from the result:

| Variety | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Fuji    | 5.00  |

This may not be what a given query optimizer really does to execute a join, but the result is the same regardless of the algorithm. If a query optimizer does something different, it is for efficiency, not correctness. *Every* join *always* involves a cross product followed by choosing the desired data from the result.
