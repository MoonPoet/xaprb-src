Sales people contact me a lot. This is common for anyone who's a founder or executive in a growing company, and I've done it too. I don't mind. Some of the people who've reached out to try to sell me things have turned into friends and allies. I've even bought from some.

But there are different kinds of sales outreach, and some of it just isn't effective. I frequently respond to people who contact me and give them advice! I'm sharing this advice here in case it's helpful for you.

The key to effective sales outreach, in the circles I move in anyway, is to realize that there's either a need, timing, and budget or there isn't. The outreach itself cannot cause a sale to happen that the prospect wouldn't otherwise engage in.

So the point of the sales outreach is to hope that you're in the right place at the right time. It's that simple.

If you've landed in the inbox of someone who has a need, the time is right, and they are able to complete a purchase, then congratulations. Don't mess anything up, and you'll have a new customer.

But the reverse is also true: if you're contacting someone who has no need, the timing is wrong, etc then nothing will make them buy from you.

And this is what so many sales reps seem to get wrong. I know why it happens, by the way. They've been taught, and there are best-selling books advocating, obnoxious sales techniques. (Before I figured it out, I used them myself).

I'm talking about the obnoxious fake breakup email, for example. "Hey Baron, I thought we were so good together. Do you not love me anymore? Sob. Well, this is goodbye. Here, have a funny gif."

Another losing tactic is the long, rambling email that wastes the first few sentences on silly things like "Hi, my name is Baron Schwartz, and I'm reaching out to you today because I see you are a Founder and CEO on LinkedIn. Congratulations on your company's recent rapid growth in the marketplace!" Every word, except for "Hi," is a waste in that email. (The name is redundant: it should already be in the From: line of the email header).

Here's an example of an email that I'm going to delete without even opening. I can tell with 100% certainty it's just someone wasting my time.

The best sales outreach emails optimize for simplicity and directness. They waste no words in the subject or first sentence. They are possible to scan from the preview of a lock-screen on a phone and decide whether to delete or not. These are optimized for not messing up the lucky case where they've reached the right person at the right time.
