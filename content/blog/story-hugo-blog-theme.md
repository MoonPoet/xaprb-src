I've developed a Hugo theme for this blog, and now I've published it for you to use too.
It offers a fast and responsive layout, beautiful design, built-in search, JavaScript presentations, social and SEO optimizations, and much more.
Many of the theme's features are pretty unique---for example, the extensions to give you control over formatting images, which I wrote about [here](/blog/how-to-style-images-with-markdown/), are built-in natively.

All of these features are seamlessly integrated for a great user experience.
Just install the theme into your Hugo site and go.
The theme's source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/xaprb/story/.
You can install it by simply cloning the repo and adding it to your config file:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/xaprb/story.git themes/story;\

# Edit your config.toml configuration file
# and add the Story theme.
echo 'theme = "story"' >> config.toml
```

I've published a demo site that not only showcases the theme's features, but serves as documentation too.
You can see it at https://story.xaprb.com.

Here are a few screenshots of the theme. First is what your homepage might look like:

Here's what a list page, such as a blog, looks like as you scroll through the content:

Story showcases your biography at the bottom of the page:

Story integrates RemarkJS for beautiful, simple Markdown slideshows:

I have a long list of enhancements I'd like to make, and contributions are welcomed on the GitHub repository.
