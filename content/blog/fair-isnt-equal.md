Years ago I was recruiting a replacement for myself in a leadership position, and I interviewed a Canadian man.
I remember being impressed with the candidate's thoughtfulness and people skills.
After a while I asked him, "what is something you've learned from leadership?"
<!--more-->

His response was, "I've learned that treating people fairly is different from treating them equally."
This left a lasting impression on me.
Little things bring it back to my memory: setting boundaries for my children, for example.

I grew up in a politically and religiously conservative household, and it took me many years to learn to see the wisdom and justice of affirmative action.
I had been trained to think it was "reverse discrimination."
Once I understood more of the meanings of privilege and oppression, though, the logic and humanity were inescapable.
I couldn't unlearn it, couldn't unsee it.
(If you don't know much of the centuries-long history of affirmative action in America, [learn about it here](https://www.sceneonradio.org/episode-44-white-affirmative-action-seeing-white-part-13/).)

It's the same basic principle that the candidate was explaining to me.
I didn't end up hiring that person, but I've thought about him often over the years.
Each person who crosses our path leaves us different, and hopefully better.
Certainly this man did.
