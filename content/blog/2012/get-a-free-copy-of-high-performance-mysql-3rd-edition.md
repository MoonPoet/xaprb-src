Want a free copy of [High Performance MySQL, Third Edition]({{< amz 1449314287 >}})? If you [register](http://perconalive-mysql-conference-expo-2012.eventbrite.com/) before the early-bird pricing expires for the [MySQL Conference in April](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/), and use the discount code PL-Book, you'll get to take a free copy home from the conference!

And now, a status update: I'm currently proofing the QC2 (quality control #2) revision of the book; after this, the book goes to manufacturing. The PDF is now 820 pages, which is a lot of work to proofread. You can imagine how much more in-depth we've been able to go with so many more pages.

The [free sample](http://www.highperfmysql.com/sample-chapter/) online is Chapter 8, on optimizing MySQL configuration. Liz van Dijk just tweeted this about it:

> The sample chapter of High Perf MySQL 3rd Ed is both amazingly to the point and hilarious at times. Instant buy for me.

If you haven't yet, I encourage you to take a look at the sample. Then go register for the conference to get your free copy, and I'll see you in Santa Clara! We're also arranging a book-signing at the conference, so you can get some scribbles on your copy if you want!
