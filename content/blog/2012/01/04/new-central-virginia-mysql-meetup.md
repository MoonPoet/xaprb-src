I've created a Central Virginia MySQL Meetup group for those of you in the area. Our [first event](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-MySQL-Meetup/events/46623002/) will be in a couple of weeks at [Meddius's](http://www.meddius.com/) headquarters. I'd like to meet and get to know more people in this area who use MySQL, so come out and we'll have a good time together! Oh, and beer. And pizza. Of course.
