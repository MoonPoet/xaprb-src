Eric Bergen called the second edition "[the best MySQL book on the planet](http://ebergen.net/wordpress/2010/07/20/how-to-be-a-mysql-dba-and-the-best-mysql-book-on-the-planet/)". What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying "best pizza in town," "best pizza in the world," and "best pizza on this block."
