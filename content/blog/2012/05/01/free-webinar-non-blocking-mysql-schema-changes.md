Please join me tomorrow (Wednesday) for a webinar about the new version of [pt-online-schema-change](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-online-schema-change.html), Percona Toolkit's tool for performing nonblocking ALTER TABLE operations. [Registration](http://www.percona.com/webinars/2012-05-02-zero-downtime-schema-changes-in-mysql/) is free. I will explain how the tool works and cover some typical use scenarios. This might be helpful if you're trying to decide whether the tool is right for you. I am also planning to leave plenty of time for questions!
