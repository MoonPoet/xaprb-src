The [Northern California Oracle Users Group (NoCOUG)](http://www.nocoug.org/) just published an interview with me in their journal. It's titled "A Whole New World of MySQL". You can read it in the [full journal (PDF)](http://www.nocoug.org/Journal/NoCOUG_Journal_201202.pdf), or on [Iggy Fernandez's blog](http://iggyfernandez.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/a-whole-new-world-of-mysql/). The full journal is well worth a read; there's a lot of good information.

Thanks to Iggy for such a thought-provoking interview, and for inviting me to participate!
