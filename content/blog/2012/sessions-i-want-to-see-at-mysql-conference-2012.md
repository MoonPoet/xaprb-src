In case you [live under a rock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvXqm0RdJms), the [MySQL conference](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/) starts on Tuesday. There are 8 concurrent tracks of content. Aside from [my own](/blog/2012/02/08/im-speaking-at-the-mysql-conference-in-april/ "Iâ€™m speaking at the MySQL conference in April") talks, here are the sessions I would most like to see.

On Tuesday:

*   Tutorial: [Innodb and XtraDB Architecture and Performance Optimization](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/innodb-and-xtradb-architecture-and-performance-optimization). Peter's talks are always great, and this is a perennial favorite. If you have never been, you should go to this one. You will realize how little you really know about InnoDB/XtraDB, and how much it matters.
*   Tutorial: [Linux and H/W optimizations for MySQL](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/linux-and-hw-optimizations-mysql). Last year I tweeted that Yoshinori's tutorial was the 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL, and I really wasn't exaggerating *that* much.
*   BoF session: [Percona XtraDB Cluster](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/program/bofs). I believe that this is one of the few truly groundbreaking changes to MySQL---right up there with "MySQL has transactions now" and "MySQL adds replication."

On Wednesday:

*   [MySQL Plugins---why should I bother?](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/mysql-plugins-why-should-i-bother) Sergei is the co-author of a book on plugins. Their power is not to be underestimated.
*   [Getting InnoDB Compression Ready for Facebook Scale](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/getting-innodb-compression-ready-facebook-scale). Compression is very powerful---if we can just get the implementation to work better. Facebook, apparently, has done that.
*   [The 5 minute DBA: MySQL DBA 101 for Non DBA's](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/5-minute-dba-mysql-dba-101-non-dbas). Get started fast with Matt Yonkovit's friendly, engaging and relevant talk. Spoiler: it's longer than five minutes.
*   [MySQL Optimizer Standoff MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 5.3](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/mysql-optimizer-standoff-mysql-56-and-mariadb-53). Peter at it again, this time digging into the advances in newer releases of the server, which make a huge difference on some common and important workloads.
*   [Scaling MySQL Databases for the Web](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/scaling-mysql-databases-web). This is the "Vitess" talk, a technology I'm extremely keen to hear about. It's now powering YouTube's backend.
*   BoF session: [Tungsten User Fest](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/program/bofs). Tungsten has matured into a very interesting technology in the last couple of years.

On Thursday:

*   [Oracle to MySQL migration](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/oracle-mysql-migration). Marco Tusa has actually implemented some of the most impressive migrations in MySQL's history.
*   [Spil Games: Outgrowing an internet startup](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/spil-games-outgrowing-internet-startup). This should be a great talk about running MySQL in a busy startup in the real world.
*   Here I'm torn between [MySQL and SSD: usage and tuning](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/mysql-and-ssd-usage-and-tuning) and [Common Schema: a framework for MySQL server administration](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/common-schema-framework-mysql-server-administration). (I'm always torn between at least 2 or 3 talks, but in this case especially so for some reason.)
*   [Verifying MySQL Replication Safely With pt-table-checksum 2.0](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/verifying-mysql-replication-safely-pt-table-checksum-20). If you aren't verifying that your replicas have the same data as their masters, you need to, and this is the tool to do it.
