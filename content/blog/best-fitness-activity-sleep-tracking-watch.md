title: The Best Activity Tracking Watch
---

After thinking about smart watches, activity trackers, and similar devices for a
while, I bought a Withings Steel HR. My goal was to find a traditional stylish-looking
watch with long battery life, heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, and activity
tracking. Here's my experience thus far.

TL;DR: Using the Withings Steel HR has changed the way I use my smartphone. I
love how much less distracted I am. I am happy with the health tracking
features, and I like the traditional watch styling and long battery life.

In the last few years I've kept an interested eye on the explosion of health- and
fitness-tracking devices, considering whether it was time for me to take the
plunge and get one. Broadly speaking, there are a few categories of devices on
the market, each appealing to a different user for various reasons. Here's my
summary:

- If you want an iPhone on your wrist, get an Apple Watch. It has poor
  battery life but it's seamlessly integrated with your Apple lifestyle.
- If you want the best fitness/activity tracking, look into FitBit and Garmin.
  The hardware, apps, and tracking features are unmatched.
- If you want a stylish analog watch with long battery life and full-featured
  activity tracking, check out Withings.
- If you want a hybrid digital watch with pseudo-analog styling, take a look at
  the Garmin 235 or Ticwear.

There are many more choices than these, but those represent some of the leaders
in the field. For more detail, read on.

Today's smartwatches have many features that go far beyond watch functionality.
You can make and receive calls and texts, respond to emails, dismiss calendar
alarms, get navigation guidance, and much more. In addition to features you're
used to getting from a smartphone, many devices offer a broad range of features
to measure your activity and vital signs: heart rate tracking, step counting,
GPS tracking for runs and walks, sleep tracking, and so on.

I was looking for some of what I consider to be the most important features of
these, without sacrificing the form factor and style of an analog watch. The
Withings Steel HR, a new offering on the market, was my choice because as far as
I could tell, it was the only analog watch that tracks heart rate, steps, and
sleep, and has a good battery life. I pre-ordered it before it was available and
have had it for a couple of months now. I'll review it in detail below.

I also have some experience with friends who've had some of these devices.  As
with everything, these are intensely personal choices and it's best to go to a
store where you can see and try as may of the models as possible.  For example,
FitBit is easily one of the leaders in the field of wearables, and makes
fantastic products. But are they right for me? One of my friends doesn't like
her FitBit because of the flickering lights she sees at night in bed, which I
know would bother me. I was told the FitBit Charge doesn't truly detect your
sleep automatically, though I'm not sure of that, and it may not be waterproof.
And several friends complained about the difficulty of using all its many
features. As for me, I simply don't care for the aesthetics of the FitBit, nor
the way it feels on my wrist; it has a rigid band that I dislike.

Here's a summary of some wearables and their features, to give a sense of the
market.  This is not exhaustive and may not be current or accurate. Note that
I'm not an Android user and there are far too many options in the Android
market to summarize here. I'm also not listing Jawbone; I couldn't find anyone
who was willing to recommend a Jawbone.

Each of these makes and models typically has options or related products that
have more or less functionality. For example, Withings offers an Activite Pop
that is simpler than the Steel HR, and doesn't track heart rate. But its battery
lasts 8 months instead of 25 days. Misfit has a more fully-featured watch, but
it's not analog. And so on.

It's also worth noting that the space is fast-moving. While I was biding my
time, trying to decide what I wanted, at least three watch and wearable
companies were acquired or went out of business, and several new options became available.

### The Withings Steel HR

My favorite watch was the Withings Steel HR. I'm a traditional, simplistic
watch guy; my analog watch is a Timex Weekender. I wanted a
minimalistic analog watch with long battery life and the following features if possible:

* Sleep, heart rate, and step tracking
* Activity tracking; I could take or leave this feature
* I wasn't really interested in text messages, notifications, and the like
* Other bonuses: waterproof, quick charging

One of the reasons I wanted a minimalistic product, with fewer smartphone
features and more activity-tracking features, is because my experience is a
small device with a lot of features is hard to use. I'd rather have a few
easy-to-use features than a lot. This biased me away from devices like the
Garmin Forerunner 235 and Ticwatch.

The Withings Steel HR tracks steps continuously, and heart rate every few
minutes instead of continuously, but has an exercise mode (just long-press the
button on the side to activate) that tracks continuously. It tracks sleep
automatically, detecting when you're in bed and light/deep sleep. It's able to
vibrate on your wrist when you get a text message, call, or calendar
notification, and displays the caller ID or similar. And it can act as an alarm
clock, vibrating to wake you.

It also auto-detects activities and the companion app lets you set goals and
review your health statistics.

It's mostly an analog watch in appearance, although it has a notification area
where caller ID and the like appear, and a goal tracker to show how much of your
daily step tracking goal you've achieved.

I got the black 36mm model. I like the styling.
I have found it functional, and I appreciate the long battery life. The band is
very comfortable and flexible. I wear my Withings 24x7, even in the shower. Here's a breakdown of
how well things work:

- The watch hands are slightly hard to see depending on the lighting, because
  they aren't white; they are polished stainless steel or similar.
- Sleep tracking is reasonably good, though it usually thinks I've gone to bed
  before I really do. Sometimes I sit on the couch and work in the evenings for
  a couple of hours, typing on my laptop or writing in my notebook, and it
  detects that I'm in "light sleep" during this time.
- Heart rate tracking is only directionally accurate.  Sometimes I look at it in
  the middle of an intense workout and it's reporting a heart rate of 62 when
  I'm pretty sure I'm well above 120. I've found it to report high heart rates
  when I'm at rest, too. I've also found long gaps in the tracking when I review
  the statistics in the app, such as at night. It's reasonably accurate, though,
  and over the long term it should be a good gauge of my resting heart rate
  trend, which is what I care about most.
- Step tracking is quite accurate, to within 1% or so in my tests. I am unsure
  how the step measurements from my iPhone are reconciled with the step
  measurements from the watch. Maybe they are independent.
- The battery life is about 15-20 days for me, depending on how often I activate
  the workout mode.
- Waterproof enough that I wear it in the shower. I've found it to mist a bit in
  hot weather in direct sun once.
- The setup was a bit finicky; syncing it to my phone with Bluetooth took a
  couple of tries initially. Since then it's been fine.
- The iPhone app is probably not as good as Garmin's or FitBit's, but it's
  pretty good.
- Text notifications don't seem to work. (I have an iPhone). I don't know about
  calendar notifications, because I don't use the iPhone calendar app. Update:
  Withings support told me that a non-obvious iPhone notification setting is
  necessary to make text notifications work. It's worked very well for me since
  then.
- Call notifications work well, and the caller ID displays quickly and is
  surprisingly usable for such a small area.
- At first I thought that the alarm didn't work, but now I have no trouble with
  it.

All in all, I'm happy with it. And I have to say, I've changed my mind about
getting notifications. My phone/text stays out of sight more now, and isn't
something I always have in front of me. And I have notification sounds turned to
very low volume now, so calls and texts are unobtrusive. I don't miss calls or
texts as much anymore because of loud ambient noise or whatever. In general, I
notice calls and texts more reliably now, and people around me don't, and I fuss
with my phone less. It's an unexpected win for me.

If I were to use something else instead,
might be the Fitbit Charge line of products. What are your thoughts and
experiences using any of these devices?
