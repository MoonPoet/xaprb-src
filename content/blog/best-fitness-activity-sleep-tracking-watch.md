title: The Best Activity Tracking Watch
draft: True
---

After thinking about smart watches, activity trackers, and similar devices for a
while, I bought a Withings Steel HR. My goal was to find a traditional stylish-looking
watch with long battery life, heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, and activity
tracking. Here's my experience thus far.

In the last few years I've kept an interested eye on the explosion of health- and
fitness-tracking devices, considering whether it was time for me to take the
plunge and get one. Broadly speaking, there are a few categories of devices on
the market, each appealing to a different user for various reasons. Here's my
summary:

- If you want an iPhone on your wrist, get an Apple Watch. Youâ€™ll get poor
  battery life but it'll be seamlessly integrated with your Apple lifestyle.
- If you want the best fitness/activity tracking, look into FitBit and Garmin.
  The hardware, apps, and tracking features are unmatched.
- If you want a stylish analog watch with long battery life and full-featured
  activity tracking, check out Withings.
- If you want a hybrid digital watch with pseudo-analog styling, take a look at
  the Garmin 235 or Ticwear.

There are many more choices than these, but those represent some of the leaders
in the field. For more detail, read on.

Today's smartwatches have many features that go far beyond watch functionality.
You can make and receive calls and texts, respond to emails, dismiss calendar
alarms, get navigation guidance, and much more. On the other side, many devices
offer a broad range of features to measure your activity and vital signs: heart
rate tracking, step counting, GPS tracking for runs and walks, sleep tracking,
and so on.

I was looking for some of what I consider to be the most important features of
these, without sacrificing the form factor and style of a real watch. The
Withings Steel HR, a new offering on the market, was my choice because as far as
I could tell, it was the only analog watch that tracks heart rate, steps, and
sleep, and has a good battery life. I pre-ordered it before it was available and
have had it for a couple of months now. I'll review it in detail below.

I also have some experience with friends who've had some of these devices. For
example, FitBit is easily one of the leaders in the field of wearables. But one
of my friends doesn't like her FitBit because of the flickering lights she sees
at night in bed, which I know would bother me. I was told FitBit doesn't truly
detect your sleep automatically, though I'm not sure of that, and it may not be
waterproof. And several friends complained about the build quality of recent
models, an the difficulty of using all its many features. As for me, I simply
don't care for the aesthetics of the FitBit, nor the way it feels on my wrist;
it has a rigid band that I dislike. As with everything, these are intensely
personal choices and it's best to go to a store where you can see and try as may
of the models as possible.

Here's a summary of some wearables and their features, to give a sense of the
market.  Note that I'm not an Android user and there are far too many options in
the Android market to summarize here. I'm also not listing Jawbone; I couldn't
find anyone who was willing to recommend a Jawbone.

Each of these makes and models typically has options or related products that
have more or less functionality. For example, Withings offers an Activite Pop
that is simpler than the Steel HR, and doesn't track heart rate. But its battery
lasts 8 months instead of 25 days. Misfit has a more fully-featured watch, but
it's not analog. And so on.

It's also worth noting that the space is fast-moving. While I was biding my
time, trying to decide what I wanted, at least three watch and wearable
companies were acquired or went out of business.

### The Withings Steel HR

My watch of choice was the Withings Steel HR. I'm a traditional, simplistic
watch guy. My analog watch of choice is a Timex Weekender. I wanted a
minimalistic analog watch with long battery life and the following features if possible:

* Sleep, heart rate, and step tracking
* Activity tracking; I could take or leave this feature
* I wasn't really interested in text messages, notifications, and the like
* Other bonuses: waterproof, quick charging

The Withings Steel HR tracks steps continuously, and heart rate every few
minutes instead of continuously, but has an exercise mode (just long-press the
button on the side to activate) that tracks continuously. It tracks sleep
automatically, detecting when you're in bed and light/deep sleep. It's able to
vibrate on your wrist when you get a text message, call, or calendar
notification, and displays the caller ID or similar. And it can act as an alarm
clock, vibrating to wake you.

It also auto-detects activities and the companion app lets you set goals and
review your health statistics.

It's mostly an analog watch in appearance, although it has a notification area
where caller ID and the like appear, and a goal tracker to show how much of your
daily step tracking goal you've achieved.

I got the black 36mm model. I like the style, although the watch hands are hard
to see, because they aren't white, they are polished stainless steel or similar.
I have found it functional, and I appreciate the long battery life. The band is
very comfortable and flexible. I wear my Withings 24/7. Here's a breakdown of
how well things work:

- Sleep tracking: it's reasonably good, though it usually thinks I've gone to
  bed before I really do. Sometimes I sit on the couch and work in the evenings
  for a couple of hours, typing on my laptop or writing in my notebook, and it
  detects that I'm in "light sleep" during this time.
- Heart rate tracking: I've found this not to be very accurate. Sometimes I look
  at it in the middle of an intense workout and it's reporting a heart rate of
  62 when I'm pretty sure I'm well above 120. I've found it to report high heart
  rates when I'm at rest, too. I've also found long gaps in the tracking when I
  review the statistics in the app. It's directionally correct, though, and over
  the long term it should be a good gauge of whether my resting heart rate is
  decreasing or not.
- Step tracking is quite accurate, to within 1% or so in my tests. I am unsure
  how the step measurements from my iPhone are reconciled with the step
  measurements from the watch. Maybe they are independent.
- The battery life is probably about 15-20 days for me, depending on how often I
  activate the workout mode.
- Waterproof enough that I wear it in the shower. I've found it to mist a bit in
  hot weather in direct sun once.
- The setup was a bit finicky; syncing it to my phone with Bluetooth took a
  couple of tries. Since then it's been pretty good.
- The iPhone app is decent. It is probably not as good as Garmin's or FitBit's,
  but it's pretty good.
- Text notifications don't seem to work. (I have an iPhone). I don't know about
  calendar notifications, because I don't use the iPhone calendar app.
- Call notifications work well, and the caller ID displays quickly and is
  surprisingly usable for such a small area.
- The alarm doesn't seem to work. I don't think I'm sleeping through it. I
  turned it off after a while because it seemed inconsistent, as though it only
  worked if the phone and watch were connected by Bluetooth at the exact instant
  the alarm was supposed to go. I could be wrong about this.

All in all, I'm happy enough with it. If I were to use something else instead,
it would probably be the Fitbit Charge line of products. But I just can't see
myself wearing one of those on my wrist.
