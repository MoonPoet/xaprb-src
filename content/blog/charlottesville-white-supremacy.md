---

On August 11 and 12, 2017, hundreds of white supremacists traveled to my hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia. They were here ostensibly to protest the planned removal of Confederate memorials. But the real plan was a race riot, designed to intimidate those who object to white supremacy and racism. The marchers assaulted, beat, injured, and even killed people.

Many people don't know even the outlines of what happened, and have asked me to describe it to them. I've had trouble finding a concise collection of events; it seems most of the coverage omits details or focuses only on a single incident during the rally. This post is a timeline of some of the events, along with notes I've collected in the course of the conversations I've had over the last handful of weeks.

Before you continue, note that this post links to and contains graphic, disturbing images and video.

As a quick background, Charlottesville has seen a series of protests and rallies during 2017. Most of the focus has involved memorials to Confederate leaders that the city voted to remove from its parks (although they have not yet been removed). Jason Kessler, a local "alt-right" activist, apparently initiated the event, labeled a "Unite The Right" rally. The event had national participation and coordination from many white supremacist groups.

A lot happened in the months leading up to the rally on the afternoon of Saturday, August 12. There were signs of planned violence, and everything escalated in the few days prior to the 12th. The city council tried to move the event out of the downtown area to a safer venue, away from densely populated areas and businesses. But civil rights groups defended the organizers, and a judge forced the city to leave the event at Emancipation Park.

After the failed attempts to move the event, the [hate groups](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map) who came to Charlottesville arrived early and became violent immediately. On Friday night, hundreds of people gathered at a UVA sports field without a permit, lit torches, and marched to the historic heart of the University. They chanted Nazi and anti-Semitic slogans as they marched: "[blood and soil!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Soil)" "Jews will not replace us!" They were exultant, hateful, and without fear of reprisal.

They surrounded a statue of Thomas Jefferson that stands in front of the iconic Rotunda, where they chanted, threw torches, and gave Nazi salutes. A UVA student group [live-streamed](https://www.facebook.com/UVAstudentsUNITED/videos/vb.350483125126731/837163406458698/?type=3&theater) the scene at the statue. At least one person was attacked with a torch; some had fuel thrown on them; some were maced and pepper sprayed; some were thrown to the ground and several were injured; and one person suffered a stroke caused by blunt force trauma to the neck. Police came to the scene after the marchers left, and dispersed the few people that remained---mostly students.

On Saturday morning, violence began in the morning, hours before the scheduled 2:00pm rally. There were marches and violent clashes over several city blocks and parks separated by a few miles of city streets, from McIntire Park to UVA to the central downtown area.

The white supremacists were heavily armed with sticks, pistols, chemical weapons, assault rifles, bricks, and automatic weapons. Many carried shields, wore helmets and full body armor, and some were difficult to distinguish from riot police. Some counter-protestors were also armed. The situation was far from an exercise of First Amendment free speech rights.

Some of the first violent clashes took place as the alt-right groups arrived and sought to assemble at Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E. Lee statue.

Counter-protestors stood in their way, arms linked. Witnesses reported that the white supremacist groups used well-rehearsed military-style maneuvers to try to approach the statue.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Witnesses from all groups, including the white supremacist groups, reported that the police and city response was passive.

At 11:28 am on Saturday morning, the governor [declared](https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=20924) a state of emergency, and the police used loudspeakers to announce an unlawful assembly and threatened arrests if the marchers didn't disperse. But with police standing passively and no physical separation between protestors and counter-protestors, the marchers seemed to act with impunity once they were forced out of the park itself. And there were many hundreds of people in the area, many of them far from where their vehicles were parked.

It's not clear what the authorities thought could happen next, but it's clear that the marchers didn't all try to simply leave. Many of them formed crowds and walked from place to place, trying to provoke fights. The violence escalated. There were multiple beatings, incidents of pepper-spraying, punching, bottle-throwing, improvised flame-throwers, shooting, urine tossing, and so on. 

Here are a few of the more shocking incidents.

Deandre Harris, a local schoolteacher, was singled out by a group of white supremacists who [called for his assault and death](http://www.theroot.com/white-supremacists-beat-black-man-with-poles-in-charlot-1797790092). He attempted to flee, but they knocked him to the ground just inside a parking garage and beat him with lumber and poles.

The attackers, some of whom [brandished firearms](http://www.gregpalast.com/charlottesville-gun-face-got-photo/), fled after a group of people rushed to Harris's aid. Harris and others huddled in the stairwell and waited for medical help that never came.

Richard Wilson Preston, a KKK member, called someone a racial epithet and fired a gun towards a crowd of people, then walked away past the police, who didn't move. You can see the video [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/us/charlottesville-protest-police.html).

There were many more brawls and clashes. Here's one scene near Emancipation Park, where Robert E. Lee's statue is located.

Similar incidences of violence continued to happen, and some of the people seemed to have come for no reason other than to find people to attack.

The violence peaked in the afternoon when James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car down 4th Street and accelerated into a crowd of counter-protestors, injuring dozens and killing Heather Heyer. There is footage of this incident from multiple angles: [overhead](https://www.facebook.com/matteus.frankovich/posts/10213719650762472), [street level from behind the car](https://twitter.com/brennanmgilmore/status/896434516260212737), [overhead again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4MKwzPYrbk), and finally a very long live-streamed video from a journalist who ended up [in the crowd that the car rammed into](https://www.facebook.com/TheHill/videos/10155164288944087/). If you want to watch the last one, you can start at 65:00, and when the video player shows -14:10 remaining you'll hear the sounds of the car striking people.

There was much more. Among other incidents, a state police helicopter crashed nearby while monitoring the situation, killing both officers aboard. And tension ran high for many days afterwards as follow-on incidents rattled the city. In one incident, the KKK celebrated President Trump's refusal to condemn white supremacy by announcing they'd burn a cross in front of a bagel bakery. In another, a Confederate romanticizer named Allen Armentrout saluted and stood guard for hours at Lee's statue, holding a Confederate flag while wearing an assault rifle and a pistol.

The next weekend there was a counter-rally, organized person-to-person in private. Thousands of people gathered peacefully at the same field where the neo-Nazis assembled. They lit candles and walked the same path to the center of UVA, where they sang songs of peace and justice.

I encourage you to watch video of what happened. In addition to the videos I've embedded above, you can get a good sense of the mayhem and panic of the weekend's events by watching some short montages assembled by The New York Times:

The NYT summaries are only a couple of minutes long, so I suggest you also watch the following in-depth report from VICE news correspondent Elle Reeve. You'll not only see footage of the events, but she interviewed the white supremacists. You'll hear them advocate for their own beliefs, and justify and defend why they came to Charlottesville:

I have many more thoughts about what happened in Charlottesville. I have drafted, but decided not to publish, a lot of my thoughts about the background, who was there, the official response, the planning and true intentions of the event organizers, and much more. I will stop at this for now.
