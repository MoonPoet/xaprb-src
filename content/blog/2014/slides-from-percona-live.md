Embedded below are slides for the two talks I gave at Percona Live. The first one is titled [knowing the unknowable](https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/knowing-unknowable-query-metrics). It illustrates the special regression technique we developed at VividCortex for computing the amount of CPU, IO, or other resources a query uses within MySQL.

The second one is on [building MySQL database applications with Go](https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/developing-mysql-applications-go).
