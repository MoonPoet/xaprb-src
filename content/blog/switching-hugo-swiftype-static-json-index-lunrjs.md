I was shocked how easy it was to add a browser-based search engine to this
website using [LunrJS][lunr] and [Hugo's][hugo] new content types. With a few
small changes and less than 30 minutes of work, I had a great search engine up
and running. I moved it under the menu and made it into a separate [search
page][search].

If you're interested to mimic my approach, you can see the [commit][github] that
I used to add the search page. I copy-pasted most of this code from articles
[here][halfelf-1] and [here][halfelf-2].

I'd like to express my appreciation to [Swiftype][swiftype] for their excellent
search engine, which I have now removed. I've used it for years and always loved
their service. I still use it, and will continue doing so, for cases that
require more robust capabilities.
