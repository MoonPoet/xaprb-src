title: Cursive Writing
---

When I was a child, I learned to write in cursive using the A Beka Books
homeschooling curriculum. I resumed journaling in cursive a couple years ago,
after decades of writing with block letters (printing).

Although my motivation to relearn cursive was to make my daily journaling more
special by setting it apart, I didn't simply regain what I had forgotten. I
found something entirely new, and learned a great deal I'd never known before.

<!--more-->

When I was a child, I wrote cursive with a pencil, filling journals with what I
look back on as mostly rote retellings of the day's events. At some time in my
early teens, I began to write with a ballpoint pen. I still recollect the
feeling of trying to learn how to use the pen. It was a bit frightening; I felt
out of control. I recall gripping the pen tightly and making my fingers and arm
ache. I remember my grip slipping down towards the point, slippery with sweat,
getting the ink on my fingers.

I always wondered how my older brothers wrote so quickly. Their pens darted more
quickly than my eyes could follow. When I tried, I only produced ugly scribbles.
I stayed slow and forceful. Beauty was more important than speed or relaxation.
Muscle cramps be damned.

One day my father commented that I shouldn't be writing with my fingers. I
should balance my arm on the muscles of my forearm, he told me, hold my fingers
steady, and write with my whole arm. He demonstrated.

I thought my father's writing was terrible, and I was irritated at the
suggestion that I could do anything wrong. No one had mentioned technique to me
before. I was just supposed to copy the letters by tracing them, and I had
learned how to do that. And besides, everyone always complimented my beautiful
penmanship.

I ignored my father.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

As my teenage years gave way to my early twenties, I abandoned cursive writing.
I admired my neat block printing. I thought it was precise and clear, and easier
to write. I still gave myself a conceited A+ for penmanship, based
on consistent, evenly spaced printed lettering. I never wrote cursive anymore.

I had some role models. A land surveyor who hand-lettered maps in block capitals
of a particular style; my Scoutmaster's writing; an architect. All influenced my
idea of what "good" handwriting looked like.

My writing changed over the years. During college, I felt the need to take notes
quickly. I wrote without looking at the page. I rarely read my notes. They were
practically illegible anyway. I wasn't even sure why I was taking notes, but I
thought it might help me learn the material better by hearing, seeing, and
writing.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

Later in college, I stopped writing on paper, switching to a keyboard instead. I
bought a copy of *Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing* and taught myself. I'd grown up
without computers and didn't know how to "touch-type." I typed as I wrote:
rigidly.

As I continued towards the end of college, I did an increasing amount of typing,
and it became more complex. Programming demanded a lot of numbers,
square brackets, and other special characters. I began to develop repetitive
stress injury. My arms hurt constantly, and the muscles in my forearms and the
little-finger edges of my hands twitched incessantly, night and day. My thumbs
occasionally spasmed and contracted into my palms.

One summer I took a 5-week trip for foreign language immersion, away from computers.
When I returned home, my arms and hands were still convulsing.  I began to worry
about my ability to complete college. In the middle of writing my senior thesis,
I switched my keyboard layout to Dvorak in desperation.

For the first couple of weeks I was nearly insane with frustration. Typing
"baron" on a Dvorak keyboard layout produced "xaprb." My fingers kept doing the
wrong thing. I was a fish out of water. I would try to type a simple word such
as "the" and I'd forget where the "h" was located. My fingers had no muscle
memory. It was like being in the foreign country and struggling for a familiar
word. By the time I found the "h" after a half dozen false tries, I would be
unable to remember what I'd been thinking. Sometimes I wasn't even able to
figure out how to spell the rest of the word. What is the third letter in "the,"
anyway?

One day it clicked, and I began typing in Dvorak. Slowly at first, then
eventually well enough to get by on basic daily tasks.
I also bought a larger mouse, and
stopped arching my hand across it with my fingers splayed. That helped.

I continued typing on Dvorak for the next five years or so. Despite the
enormous decrease in finger movement on Dvorak, my typing was still very slow.
Dvorak had some frequently-used letters in even less convenient locations,
especially those that required stretching my little finger up and away from my
palm. The twitching and convulsing mostly stopped, though.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

After college I rarely wrote by hand anymore. The exception was that I continued
to journal, with a few periods where I lost the habit, but always regained it.

I've journaled in many ways over the years. Sometimes I wrote about the day,
sometimes about my feelings, sometimes my memories from childhood. Gradually, my
handwriting continued to change. But it always remained forceful and tense.

Sometimes I grew frustrated with writing. No matter what I tried, my writing
was physically difficult and painful.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

I taught myself guitar when I was 10 or 11 years old, and at times played
several hours a day. The Mel Bay books and library books on classical guitar
technique all emphasized the need to be relaxed. I could relax for a few
moments, but as I concentrated on the music, my body automatically tensed, and
when my attention turned to my fingers I'd notice that I was once again mashing
the strings into the frets with an iron grip.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

When I founded VividCortex, I found myself buying and filling books full of
[notes](/blog/2013/07/10/ultimate-notebook-and-journal-face-off/). As in
college, I felt the need to write things down, but now my motivation was
clearing my mind. Writing things meant I could give myself permission to forget
them, and I was experiencing a tremendous amount of stress due to managing many
different tasks. I wanted to follow through on every thought or idea, but I knew
I couldn't. I also knew the unfinished things would recur and bother me, so I
wanted to just get rid of them. Writing them down felt safe. Putting a little
square beside them made me feel even better: it was a checkbox. Now I'd be able
to scan quickly and find unfinished tasks and ideas.

I also started journaling again, trying to cope with the
[stress](/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/) of rapid task-switching, feeling
hopelessly inadequate, all while keeping up a facade of competence.

I got back in practice with handwriting. My printed lettering grew a bit neater
and wasn't quite so difficult. But with all the note-taking during the day,
journaling in the evening didn't feel special. It felt like more of the same.

I wanted journaling to be therapeutic. I wanted to escape.  The plain,
functional printed writing felt mundane. And I knew it wasn't very attractive or
neat. I remembered when I used to congratulate myself on my writing.

I felt at times like an utter failure.  In a time of crisis, I decided to begin
writing cursive again, just as I'd switched to Dvorak during the middle of
writing an epic treatise on XML and music notation. I knew it would be
frustrating, and I didn't need any more frustration, but 
I needed something to get me out of the ditch. Maybe, secretly, I
wanted to relearn beautiful cursive handwriting so I could feel okay about
myself again.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

It was painful at first. The pen went all different ways. I didn't remember the
right way to make some of the letters. I decided I didn't care and plowed on.
Who cared if a capital T looked like an F. Not me. Gradually, I practiced and
remembered and got a little better and remembered something else again. How many
loops in a lowercase "z" again? Oh, right. Why was it so hard to get uppercase C
and E to have attractively shaped loops? And why did an uppercase K look like an
H? Eventually I made shapes that pleased me more and looked like I thought they
were supposed to, while at the same time becoming more accepting of them as they
were.

Over time, I developed spasmodic typographical errors: I would write "time" and
there would be a t, followed by some number of spikes and humps. Sometimes I'd
be unable to control how many, and end up with two or three letters "m" joined
together, the pen jerking up and down too many times. It felt out of control,
which was not what I wanted.

Something else worried me: I was once again gripping the pen too hard. I tried a
few different types of pen. I'd been using felt markers in my notebooks, but
they didn't feel good. Ballpoint pens felt better, but I was still cramping my
hand and tensing my shoulders.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

But then something happened. It wasn't just that the writing was pleasing to
look at. That, yes. But more importantly, it felt better to write.

Maybe my body was tense while I was writing, but my mind was more at ease.

It had a lot to do with the letters themselves. Joined together, they flowed.
There was no discontinuity. I realized that when I was writing printed block
letters, each letter was a thought. Each time I lifted, moved, or placed the
pen, marked the boundary of a thought. But in cursive, there was no mental
boundary between glyphs. A word became a thought.

![Sample](/media/2016/06/sample.jpg)

And then the pen started to move by itself.

It still went crazy sometimes, leaving out loops or adding too many in. But when
I dared to pause my thoughts---almost like the mental equivalent of holding my
breath---and just watched what happened, the pen would write a whole word of its
own volition. I wasn't doing it. I was just the
[observer](/blog/2016/03/19/meditation/). My role was merely to try not to
interfere.

And then the pen would lift itself and the next word would flow from its tip
onto the paper, and the next.

The more I let this happen, the more I became a participant, the more absorbed I
became.  At times I became conscious that I could not see anything outside of a
dime-sized area around the tip of my pen. I'd blink and snap out of it, aware of
the room again.  Aware that I felt more at peace, that the noisy, self-critical
parts of my brain had grown a bit quieter.

I still was very tense, and when I'd come to full consciousness again I'd have a
stiff neck and aching knuckles. But I'd also have that light, spacious sense of
having suspended the world for a time.

Journaling was special again. Different, but not in the ways I'd expected. It
was meditative. It helped me place a barrier between the stress and anxiety of
the day, and the night. It helped me fall asleep a little bit more easily.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

One day I decided to treat myself to a special pen as a reward for journaling,
to give myself an incentive. Something extra to look forward to each night.
So I bought a fountain pen. My mother always wrote with a fountain pen and said
it was nice.

I looked on Amazon and picked out what seemed like a good value for starters:
a $15 [Pilot fountain
pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KRPFD96/?tag=xaprb-20). I didn't know
anything about fountain pens. I wasn't even sure what to do for ink or how to
take care of it.

I was afraid of damaging the pen at first, because the tip
just looks so delicate. I was also afraid of spilling or smearing ink. But those
fears vanished quickly. It was easy to adjust.

Again, journaling became more special, but not because I'd given myself a
present. This time, I realized I'd stumbled upon the solution to a lifelong
problem: fountain pens are *easy* to write with.

You don't have to press hard. Friction plays no role. Unlike a ballpoint pen,
which requires enough pressure to deform the paper around the ball and grip it
to roll it, a fountain pen works by capillary action. Just touch the paper and
the ink flows. You need practically zero pressure.

The result was remarkable.  During writing, my brain, which was already
thrilling at the sensation of letting go and letting the words write themselves,
was finally able to really let go and get out of the way. My fingers relaxed of
their own accord. My hand lightened. My arm and shoulder became free. The
pen---such a solid, balanced weight---glided through space freely, drawing my
arm with it.

I was balancing my arm on my forearm muscles, brushing the paper with the heel
of my hand, keeping my fingers mostly still and steady. The writing was coming
from my wrist and arm, not my knuckles. I was completely flowing, in the zone.

And depending on how much and how completely I let go, I write *quickly* now.
The pen moves faster than I can really track with my eyes, yet the shapes of the
letters are nearly as elegant as slowed-down writing.

I guess fathers do know things sometimes. It just takes a son a few decades to
understand it.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

I'm not the only one who's discovered this. It turns out that ballpoint pens
might have helped [kill off cursive writing](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/).
I'm so glad I discovered a fountain pen. I'm almost literally (pun intended) in
love with writing now. I'm also glad that fountain pen technology has advanced
so remarkably since the ballpoint pen came on the scene, addressing many of the
reasons ballpoint pens were superior at the time. Those advances have made my
writing experience more pleasurable.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

What is it about cursive writing that's so special? Some people think the
griping about the loss of cursive skills is just old-timers who can't let go of
things that are past.  I can tell you it's more than nostalgia.  Cursive writing
has very real value to me as an individual; value it never held when I was a
child.

I started to get interested in drawing at one time, and my wonderful, amazing
wife gave me a copy of *Drawing On The
Right Side Of The Brain.* Among other things, this book taught me the origins of
the phrase "split-brain syndrome" that we use in clustered database systems. (It
comes from [Nobel-Prize-winning experiments on patients with severe
epilepsy](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html).)
But that's not what I remember the most from this period of my life.

This book's gift to me was an improved consciousness of different modes of
thought. As I practiced drawing, I began to recognize what they call
"right-brain" and "left-brain" thinking. Now, I'm not at all sure that these
types of thought actually occur physically in these parts of the brain, but I
learned to identify many flavors of thought: logical, procedural, verbal,
musical, sonic, spatial, structural, and perhaps more. Maybe science would put
these into different categories, but what I know is that they each feel
different to me. And through meditation, I started to recognize and describe the
types of thoughts I need and use when I'm doing different things. Speaking to a
group of people, drawing, writing, running, remembering, designing a complicated
program, debugging and checking the logic of that program: all are very
particular combinations of various kinds of thoughts.

Writing in cursive in my journal is *different* than printing letters. It's even
more different when using a fountain pen. It makes my brain behave differently.

I think cursive is special for several reasons. A cursive word is a single, complex,
flowing line, composed of many repeating units and basic atoms, which has a
meaning and shape as a whole, but also has component parts. This is completely
different from simple disconnected stick letters. Writing in this way activates
and concentrates different parts of my brain, different types of thoughts.

That's why it's so meditative and therapeutic, so calming. So flowing. I doubt
that I've ever been "in the zone" while writing one letter at a time, but it
happens all the time with cursive.

Oddly (or perhaps not), I can't use my fountain pen for ordinary writing. It's
jarring. I can't take notes in cursive, nor can I write printed letters with my
fountain pen. My fountain pen is for journaling (and sometimes letter writing),
in cursive, and my brain locks up awkwardly if I try to do anything else with
it.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

Having relearned cursive, I have discovered a great love for hand lettering. I
see it everywhere and admire it.

A few examples. Wendy Xu created some [stunning
lettering](http://petitserif.com/portfolio/altered-tastes/) for a recent *New
Republic* article. I could hardly believe it was done by hand, but by relaxing
my eyes I was able to get letters from different parts of the page to overlap
and I could see that the shapes were not perfectly the same.

![Quote](/media/2016/06/petitserif_alteredtastes_quote1.png)

I look at computer fonts and I think about how
they might have been inspired by or evolved from handmade letterforms.
Lettering and typefaces hold more meaning for me now. They're more special.

I also enjoy calligraphy. I have not practiced it myself, but I like to watch
videos of people writing with pens, brushes, and the like. Here's one
I found somewhere:

{{< youtube XMolEvB5EqA >}}

Here's another I found on
[This is Colossal](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/calligraphy/). 

{{< youtube F4165Pp8uns >}}

Buying a book on calligraphy has deepened my appreciation for it, even though
I've not made time to practice it.

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

There are many resources for learning to write in different styles. There are
many styles of cursive, for that matter: Spencerian, Palmerian, A Beka Book, ZB,
the list goes on. The [IAMPETH](http://www.iampeth.com/) and Michael Tull have
helped create a revival of sorts by making vast amounts of tutorial and
demonstration material available online in various media (PDF, video...)

I'm continuing to improve my writing, in the sense that I feel better when
writing. It's no longer about my ego, nor do I kid myself that I have writing
like Wendy Xu. (I'm pretty sure that when I was a teenager, I thought my writing
was that good). It's about finding peace with myself, with the way things are,
and watching myself write shapes that I find beautiful. And, more importantly,
feeling that I am more relaxed and creating more beautiful writing today than I
was a year ago.

I hope you find enjoyment and beauty in writing, whether your own or someone
else's.
