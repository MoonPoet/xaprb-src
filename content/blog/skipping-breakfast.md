tldr: "Six months ago I stopped eating breakfast, and everything I thought I knew about my body and food turned out to be untrue. I discovered that breakfast makes me hungry, I didn't know what a normal appetite was like, and all the wisdom and advice I'd gotten about breakfast was wrong. At the same time, every objective measure of health and fitness has improved."

Around the middle of 2018, I stopped eating breakfast, and what's happened to my body since then has blown my mind.
Like many people, I spent my entire life hearing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
I believed it, of course.
Why wouldn't I?
It was an opinion echoed unanimously by everyone who should know---medical professionals, nutrition experts, and so on.
But my recent experience has shown the exact opposite is true: eating breakfast is actively bad for my body.

Disclaimers: I am not a doctor and this article is not medical advice; links in this article aren't endorsements.
Even more importantly, what works for me is probably not going to work for other people.
I'm not going to compare myself and my situation to others, or be so arrogant as to suggest that if you just do as I do, you'll get what I got.
I know a lot of people struggle with medical conditions, eating disorders, life circumstances, and other things that make my experiences irrelevant to theirs, and in no way do I want to pass any judgments about anyone's situation or imply that I think what's easy for me will be easy for others.
I hope that by sharing my experiences, someone finds something helpful in some way, and that's as far as it goes.

Here's the short version:

- Eating breakfast doesn't stave off my hunger, it amplifies it.
- For decades I didn't know the difference between hunger and appetite.
- Every measurable vital sign and lab test has improved since I stopped eating breakfast.
- My metabolism is *not* decreased and I am *not* starving or depriving myself.
- The reasons why all this works are logical and sensible: I've gotten off the insulin/sugar merry-go-round.
- The key is to have periods of fasting, when my body isn't processing food and can establish equilibrium.

If you want the long version, read on below.

### The Large Breakfast Treadmill

I used to eat a large breakfast because I was trying to stave off hunger before lunch.
[I even wrote a blog post about it.](/blog/2015/06/05/maximize-productivity-in-three-easy-steps/)
But it wasn't working.
By late morning I was hungry, irritable, distracted.
I'd eat a snack to tide me over till lunch.
When I got home from work in the evening, I was always too hungry to cook, and I needed a snack before I started preparing a proper meal.

I stopped eating breakfast and after about two weeks, the most remarkable change started happening.
I wasn't hungry at 10:30am anymore, and going till noon without eating was no problem.
And my pre-dinner cravings were gone, too.
Breakfast was making me *more* hungry, not less!
Again, that absolutely blew my mind.

### Hunger and Appetite

Even more surprising than my decreased hunger was the new, strange feeling that replaced it: appetite.
I have spent a lot of time thinking about it, and I'm pretty sure that I have never in my life experienced the difference until last year.
But the difference is obvious to me now that I have had both hunger and appetite.
What I'm calling "hunger" is a gnawing craving for food, accompanied by moodiness.
What I'm calling "appetite" is a totally different sensation: it's my body's readiness---but not a demand---to eat.
It's a sensation of having reached equilibrium, a neutral feeling like my body is "finished" with the last meal.
It's a rested, quiet feeling.
It's pleasant.
It feels optional: just an awareness, a fact, an FYI that my body is giving me.
The hunger I used to experience, on the other hand, was an insistent request, not an FYI.

Now that I don't eat breakfast, I can skip lunch too, and the "FYI, I'm done digesting" feeling stays the same.
I sometimes extend my fast until dinnertime or the next day, and the sensation slowly grows, but it never turns into desperation.
I have the feeling I could fast for many days and I'd be aware of my readiness to eat the entire time, but it wouldn't be a problem.
(I doubt this is true, but the contrast of this appetite to the hunger I formerly knew is so remarkable that I get this impression.)

When I do eat, the sensation of my body digesting food is likewise very noticeable.
It's familiar: it was the 24x7 state of my body for my first several decades.
I never was aware of it before because it was a constant, but now that I sense it only while I'm processing a meal, it's very distinctive to me.
I wake up in the morning and I can tell I'm still processing last night's supper.
By midmorning, I've completed digestion, and the digestion sensation---which permeates my entire body, not just my stomach---fades over the course of a couple of hours.
Then I enter a state of equilibrium or neutrality, as I said, and from there after a time I sense a readiness for more food, should I choose to eat it.

### Insulin and Sugar, Food, Fasting, Sleep

The reason this all works is because of the intricate, interconnected machinery of insulin, blood sugar, and other stuff that happens when I eat food.
I've delved into a handful of books to learn more about it, and I can't do it justice in this article, because there is quite a spiderweb of causes and effects.
It's a lot more complicated than just insulin and sugar, but as a gross oversimplification, the interplay between those two substances is one of the more obvious things going on.

The short, oversimplified version is that when you eat, your blood sugar spikes, and your body produces insulin to deal with it in the short term, then has other processes to put that back into equilibrium later.
There's a complex dynamic of several processes getting activated, some of which are causing others to activate, and so on.
After a while it all settles down---unless you keep adding more food in before everything's had a chance to complete.

And this is the key insight: my body isn't supposed to process food all day every day.
It needs to have periods of fasting.
Note that I'm not making any claims about other peoples' bodies.
I'm only telling you what is unmistakably true about mine.

I know because I've been studying whatever I can about all the factors involved, which include non-food things like sleep.
And I've run a bunch of experiments.
For example, I've eaten a few breakfasts once in a while.
I'm very attuned to how my body feels now, so I notice the effects right away.
I am certain that if I were to resume my old habit of eating at 8:00am, 10:30am, 12:00pm, 4:00pm, and 6:00pm again, in a matter of a few days I'd be in a state of constant digestion/processing again.
I know I would, because during the holidays when I feasted with my family, I both measured it and felt it happen.

I'm also very attuned now to the effects of how well I sleep.
I paid a lot of attention to this because sleep has a profound and immediate impact on insulin sensitivity, which triggers hunger, and so on.
You might have noticed that I reviewed a variety of sleep-tracking smartwatches and other devices last year.
It wasn't idle play: I was building spreadsheets of my weight, resting pulse, what I ate, how hungry I felt, how much energy I had, and how I slept.
It didn't take long before I could see the patterns.
For example, once I stayed up late cleaning up some damage from a sudden storm that struck around bedtime.
The next morning, and the following few days, the effects of a four-hour night of sleep were easily measurable.
Likewise, I was able to easily correlate the effects of travel---I traveled a lot last year---with sleep disruption, meals, and subjective and objective observations.

### Exercise, Metabolism, Weight, and Lab Tests

When I stopped eating breakfast, there was an immediate and positive change in some of my vital signs over a period of a month or so.
Some of the other biometrics that I track over longer timescales have improved, too.
I'm not going to post personal medical records online for the world to see, but I'm willing to share my anonymized weight.
Here's a chart of my weight over the course of 2018.

![My body weight over the course of 2018](/media/2019/01/weight.png)

The midyear change when I stopped eating breakfast is obvious.
Later in the year, after I stopped traveling, I slowly started to regain some of the muscle weight I'd lost due to not being able to exercise as intensely as I could at home.
This screenshot is from a Withings scale, which also estimates body fat, water, bone, and muscle.
If I showed you those charts you'd see that they have continued to gradually improve as well.

What happened to my body midyear to make me lose weight so sharply?
I wasn't overweight and I didn't think I had much to lose, to tell you the truth.
I explain the chart above by reasoning that I probably lost internal "visceral" fat.
And nothing in all the statistics that my doctors and I track---hemoglobin A1C, lipids, etc---has done anything but improve either.
They were fine before, but now they're better than fine.

In fact, everything I have been able to measure about my body substantiates my theory that introducing a few more hours of fasting every day has broken the insulin/sugar feedback loop, and allowed my body's "thermostat" to reset to the natural weight I *should* have.

Nothing else has changed, at least as far as I can see from my ridiculously meticulous daily notes and measurements.
I still exercise every single day, almost always an intense 4-10 minute workout based on skills I gained in CrossFit.
I still periodically do very heavy, highly taxing workouts that are longer as well.
And then, I shower, go to work, and wait hours and hours before I eat, and *it's fine*.
I never would have believed it if I hadn't tried it and seen what happened.

But what about "my body entering starvation mode" and "I've just slowed down my metabolism" and things like that?
It's not happening.
I still eat just as much as I did, but now I eat it during a shorter interval of time during the day.
I just eat bigger lunches and dinners than I used to.
And I'm pretty sure that I know my metabolism really well now, much better than I ever used to.
I'm just so much more *conscious* of what's going on with my body.
I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I can measure about my body over the past two years.
I've bought a glucose meter and pricked my finger ten times a day, I've done a bunch of stuff.
I'm not getting cold, I'm not entering "ketosis," I'm not experiencing anything abnormal.
My body is working great.
It just is.
This is how it's *supposed* to work.

### This Flies In The Face Of Medical Advice

All of this is significantly at odds with established medical wisdom.
I think the medical wisdom is wrong.
I think medical *science* is far ahead of medical *practice*, and interestingly, medical *science* doesn't argue against what I've written in this article.
I know this because I am really engaged with medical professionals and I observe that what's practiced in the doctor's office is very different at times from what's been in published research for years, even decades.

To put this into perspective, one of the books I got, which focused on C-Reactive Protein and was written by a practicing physician, at one point nearly screamed that whatever you do, *you must not skip breakfast*.
It will shut down your metabolism and induce profoundly counterproductive starvation measures that will cause cycles of overcorrection and yo-yo weight, he said.
Based on my own experience, and not making any claims about what it'll do for others, that hasn't turned out to be true.
Based on the medical science I've read, the experiences I'm relating in this article are much more logical and my experiences are much more to be expected than this doctor's fears about metabolism shutdowns.

Of all the books I've read, the following two have given me the most to think about:

* [The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss]({{< amz 1771641258 >}}) by Dr. Jason Fung
* [Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams]({{< amz 1501144324 >}}) by Matthew Walker PhD

If you triangulate what those two books have to say about sleep, insulin, stress hormones, and a dozen other topics, then everything I've experienced over the last two years, and the decades before that, makes perfect sense.
Both of those books are written by people who are more scientists/researchers than doctors, and the sources are cited.
I spent a lot of time following the citations and reading the research.

### Our Obesity Crisis and Quackery, and a Disclaimer

Part of the reason I wanted to write about this is to raise awareness.
My situation is not typical.
I'm extraordinarily privileged to be healthy and able to tinker with my body like this and see what happens.
I feel that keenly, and I'm motivated to help if I can.

We are in the beginning stages of staggering public health crises related to malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and a myriad of other problems.
One article that surveys part of the situation is [Everything You Know About Obesity Is Wrong](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/).
It's hard to convey---actually impossible to overstate---the severity of the health problems the current and next few generations must contend with.

At the same time, medical science is advancing at an astonishing rate, and we have more and better answers now by far than we did a scant few years ago.
Yet there's also a stunning volume of misinformation newly available, especially online.
There are all kinds of untested, unregulated, unresearched alternative medicine products and "programs" available, many of them absolutely mainstream but still snake oil, while celebrity doctors appear as guests on celebrity TV shows and promote them.

Meanwhile, your doctor probably got [no more than a few days of instruction on nutrition in medical school](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jbe/2015/357627/) and might be unprepared to help guide you through the rapidly changing landscape of the nutritional challenges you face everyday, not to mention staying up to date with the latest research.

Blog posts like the one you're reading right now are part of the problem!
When a blogger says they've done research, it usually means they Googled and then read a bunch of blog posts from some charismatic dude with chiseled abs and a big social media following.

That doesn't describe how I've arrived at my current understanding of how my body works.
Over the past several years I've read literally hundreds of peer-reviewed journal articles from leading research publications.
(I've also encountered a lot of pseudo-research.)
Nonetheless, I am neither a trained journalist, nor a scientist, and I have no professional qualifications to write an article like this one.
Nor do I have incentives not to publish things like this if I'm just making it up.
Among the reasons you shouldn't trust me, for example, is that I will not lose my license to practice, or get fired, for doing so.

The combination of factors mentioned in this section leaves everyone in a difficult position.
We know more than we ever did about how to be healthy, but it's harder to find the truth than it ever was.
We're suffering from serious problems that need expert help from qualified people, but that's harder and harder to find, so we're extremely sick and getting sicker fast.

I don't know what to do about this, but again I hope that drawing attention to the situation helps a little.

### Conclusions

I have been wanting to write this article for a long time, but what pushed me past the tipping point was my annual physical exam earlier this week.
The doctor reviewed all of my lab results, examined me, and then congratulated me.
"Whatever you're doing is working great, keep it up!" she said.

I handed her a printout of my daily meal spreadsheet to ask if she had any suggestions about my diet.
I kept notes about what I ate at each meal for several months, as I mentioned previously, and I'd brought it in for her.
She paged through it.
"This is great," she said.
"You're eating really well. I love what I'm seeing here---" and she named a few foods and praised me.
"But I want you to eat breakfast more often," she said.
