title: What Women Tell Me
---

Someday I'll write a companion blog post about what men tell me, but today I
want to write about what I've learned by listening to women over the last few
years.

Why do I care? It's because women tell me things that men rarely, sometimes
*never* tell me. I failed to notice this for the longest time, but when I
started to, I decided to sit up and listen, hard.

*Disclaimer: I'm not saying that men don't care or talk about these types of
things. In fact, many of these episodes of sexism came to me through a man's
Twitter post. BUT WOMEN RETWEETED IT TO ME.*

![Gramophone](/media/2016/08/gramophone.jpg)

I will now present things I have heard only or mostly from women, in many cases
without attribution to the original author or the woman who drew this to my
attention (because I think that's the safest thing to do).

### The Virginia Governor's UVA Board Appointment Announcement

The Daily Progress, my local newspaper, featured [a
story](http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/governor-names-new-members-to-uva-board/article_348dc0e0-31a6-11e6-900f-c3685e74dae3.html)
about some high-profile appointments to one of Virginia's most influential
positions. Emphasis mine:

> Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Monday named four new members to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors and reappointed another.  The new members include two major donors to a McAuliffe PAC, **the wife of** the former chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party and an ophthalmologist.  These are the new members:
> ...
>
> * Elizabeth M. Cranwell, of Roanoke, a public relations professional. Cranwell is married to former state Democratic Party Chairman Richard "Dickie" Cranwell.  Cranwell graduated from UVa’s College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences in 1986.

Why is Elizabeth M. Cranwell's biography all about her husband?  I
understand that there's an argument that the significance of her appointment is
partially because of her husband's political connections. But *leading* the
phrasing with that identifies her as her husband's property, minimizes her own
abilities and accomplishments (which appear to be significant, on further
research), and is just all-around sexist. Would it have been acceptable to talk
about her and then end with a mention of her husband? Yes, it would have.

### Sexual Harassment of Gretchen Carlson

Watch this video of a woman dealing with sexual harassment on live television,
and see if you can imagine yourself in this situation. If this happens in front
of the camera, what do you think happens off-set?

### Overdoing It Isn't Optional

While listening to women I've heard again and again that they have to
outperform in a way I am not required to. As one person put it, the choice is to
succeed and risk burning out, or taking care of herself and risking being passed
over for a promotion or otherwise losing ground she's fought for so hard and
long. Many studies prove that this is not an imaginary consequence, it's simple
reality.

One woman noted that it was a tough decision for her not to attend an industry
trade show late in her pregnancy, *even though her doctor told her not to
go.* She took the doctor's advice, but still felt fearful she'd damaged her
career.

As a man, when I hear these things I realize I don't have to think about this
type of stuff. It just doesn't occur to me. (That's the definition of male
privilege, by the way.) As I said on social media, I don't feel that I have to
make this type of choice. (Three women and one man signaled their approval of
that statement).

### Women, Confidence, and Competence

Why aren't there more women in leadership positions? This [study](https://hbr.org/2016/07/to-seem-confident-women-have-to-be-seen-as-warm) indicates that it could be because we judge women's competence and ability differently than men's.

> Our study, which has been accepted for presentation at the Academy of
> Management’s conference in August, shows that men are seen as confident if
> they are seen as competent, but women are seen as confident only if they come
> across as both competent and warm. Women must be seen as warm in order to
> capitalize on their competence and be seen as confident and influential at
> work; competent men are seen as confident and influential whether they are
> warm or not.

And why do so many incompetent men hold leadership positions? Perhaps because we
mistake hubris for ability, and [men are more arrogant than women]
(https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men)?

> The truth of the matter is that pretty much anywhere in the world men tend to
> think that they that are much smarter than women. Yet arrogance and
> overconfidence are inversely related to leadership talent — the ability to
> build and maintain high-performing teams, and to inspire followers to set
> aside their selfish agendas in order to work for the common interest of the
> group. Indeed, whether in sports, politics or business, the best leaders are
> usually humble — and whether through nature or nurture, humility is a much
> more common feature in women than men.

Dozens, even hundreds, of studies show that men perceive assertive women as
abrasive. So women have to tiptoe around everything in the workplace.
Several women reacted to [this humor column
ironically coaching women on ways to be
non-threatening](http://thecooperreview.com/non-threatening-leadership-strategies-for-women/),
by saying it *actually is how they have to act and advise each other to behave*. An excerpt:

> Downplay your ideas as just "thinking out loud,"
> "throwing something out there," or sharing something "dumb,"
> "random," or "crazy."

Men rarely or never share this type of stuff with me. But, then again men literally
[never see this word in their performance
reviews](http://www.fastcompany.com/3034895/strong-female-lead/the-one-word-men-never-see-in-their-performance-reviews)
either.

### Why Call Out That She's A Woman?

When women are celebrated for their achievements, they're often qualified as
exclusively women's achievements. It's a thinly veiled leftover from the
"separate spheres" sexism of decades past, reminding us that this doctrine is
*not* really in the past.  From a [Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serena-williams-greatest-athletes_us_577e884ee4b0344d514e3d7d)
article about Serena Williams:

> “There will be talk about you going down as one of the greatest female
> athletes of all time. What do you think when you hear someone talk like that?”
> the reporter asked.
> 
> When she opened her mouth, her answer was short and quick, but decisive and
> telling. 
> 
> “I prefer the word ‘one of the greatest athletes of all time,’” she said. 
> 
> In a sentence, Williams politely made clear everything wrong with the way the
> question was phrased. For almost her entire life, the 34-year-old has been
> exacting her punishment on her opponents. Few have done what she has done, and
> by the time she’s ready to retire, likely no one will have. To box her into
> the category of “female athletes” ― to say she is great, but just great “for a
> girl” ― is a dig, accidental or not, that she has every right to call out. And
> more so, that she should. 

### A Woman's Historic Achievement Celebrated by Pictures of Husband

The day after Hillary Clinton became the first woman in 240 years to be
nominated as a major US party's candidate for President, many mainstream
newspapers (Boston Globe, San Francisco Chronicle, Washington Post, Houston
Chronicle, Chicago Tribune, and many others) featured giant front-page pictures
of her husband or other candidates, *but not her*. Understandably, women
expressed outrage about this.

I expected that men would be incensed too, but I really didn't hear much from
them about it.

### See If You Can Spot It

Here's the anonymized "about us" leadership page from a venture-backed startup.
This is real, not fake; I've just omitted names. There's only one woman on this
page. Can you guess which one?

* President and CEO
* Co-Founder and Executive Chairman
* Chief Financial Officer
* Vice President of Professional Services
* Vice President of Software Development
* Chief Technology Officer
* Senior Vice President of Engineering
* Senior Director, Marketing

Hint: who's last in the list? Who's not a C-level or VP-level?

Hypothetical question: if they'd hired a man for that role, do
you think he would have been titled *Vice President of Marketing*, or *_Senior_ Vice President of Marketing*?

### Sexy Technology

The women I follow on Twitter don't talk about technology in sexualized terms
and don't appreciate men who do. The architecture isn't "gorgeous," and the
features aren't "sexy" or "hot." They're "impressive" instead, to use one
possible alternative word.

They also don't appreciate people who talk about other people as "rock stars,"
"ninjas," and the like. They call this out often. I don't remember the last
time a man did.

### Celebrations of Humane Treatment In The Workplace

Womens' experiences in the workplace are dramatically different from mens'.
Women whom I follow emphasize how much it matters to them that:

* Managers explicitly allow things like personal phone calls at work. Why is
  this a big deal? Women are most often the "default parent" responsible for
  things like scheduling dental appointments and a myriad of other things that
  need to be done for children.
* Fathers should have paid leave when they have a new baby. The assumption,
  widespread in many workplaces, is that women can and will do the child-rearing
  and the man can and should go back to work the next day. As if, even if she
  does most of the child-rearing, she isn't going to need any help!

Men typically don't share this type of stuff with me. They (we) enjoy the privileges of a
male-oriented society without having to ask. As a result, even though
there is no reason that the things in the following image aren't as important to
men as women, I saw only women share this image in my social media
streams. Men seemed indifferent to it. Women have shared with me that they often
feel taking these types of "liberties," or even just asking if they're OK, will
raise a flag that could be used against them later, consciously or
unconsciously.

### Sexist Stuff Seems Normal To You

Women's voices (including my wife) have been the main reason I now regard many
things as sexist which I used to take in stride. They share things and point out
the sexism I didn't see before. Needless to say, men rarely if ever do this.

Watch this series of interview questions posed to Hillary Clinton over the
years:

{{< youtube mSYZ12LGVxw >}}

Is *all of it* it blatantly sexist, in your opinion? I wouldn't have thought so
myself. I thought there were some pretty sexist things in there, along with
places where maybe, just maybe, someone was being a *little bit too sensitive.*
At least, that is, until I listened to how women reacted to it. It's a series of
subtle and sometimes unsubtle implications, which are definitely and
unambiguously sexist.

Here's how [a female writer (of course!) at
Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12377900/hillary-clinton-sexist-interview-questions) summed it up:

> Pundit after pundit, in decade after decade, asks why voters don’t like
> Clinton. And pundit after pundit answers their own questions without realizing
> it. Is it possible that people could like a woman who is independent and
> opinionated?

It's not just a little bit sexist. It's *flaming* sexist. The problem isn't
oversensitive women, it's that I've not yet learned enough empathy for a reality
other than my own.

### Conference Culture Matters

Women, more so than men, call out unacceptable behavior at conferences,
especially those in male-dominated industries such as gaming, security, and
tech.

If it weren't for listening to women I don't think I'd feel so strongly about
the need for [codes of
conduct](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq) at
conferences.

Women are typically the ones who post pictures of cringe-inducing things at
conferences, such as a booth with a woman dressed in basically nothing,
ostensibly selling cloud storage or something.

Women are the ones who stand up for women who've been attacked or made
uncomfortable at such conferences.

Many more women than men (that I follow, anyway) have retweeted this man's
[expose of a DEFCON
incident](https://twitter.com/dhelder/status/761777348458913796) that defies my
language skills:

![Dick Jeopardy](/media/2016/08/jeopardy.jpg)

The tweet's text is "Hacker Jeopardy. Category is "Dicks".  Men play. Women give
them beers. Why aren't there more women in security?"

DEFCON is one of the biggest security-related conferences in the world.
In case you missed it, here's a close-up of what's happening at the table:

### Women Don't Need A Bunch Of Pink Stuff

Next time you're in the grocery store, drug store, or whatnot: take a walk
through the sections of the store that are targeted towards women. Feminine care
items, hair accessories, and the like. You'll almost surely see "female
versions" of unisex products. The difference is typically packaging,
coloring, and bullet points of product attributes meant to be "feminine." Does
this bother you?

It bothers many women I know. A lot. It's insulting to them. Bright yellow
and non-ultra-soft earplugs are fine, thank you. I'll cite the
[source](https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz/status/760641088625356800) for this
one because she's quite a public figure. Her comment: "BEEN WAITING SO LONG 4
THIS! Do they double as tampons? Or are they just great at blocking sexual
slurs?"

![Earplugs](/media/2016/08/earplugs.jpg)

### Some Other Stuff

Here's a laundry list of things archived in my Pocket account that I've read and
tried to internalize, and which were brought to my attention by women:

* In many societies women are routinely murdered by their families for any display of independence ("honor killings"). When this happens, people often say "the murder was wrong, but [so was her behavior](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/who-blames-the-victim.html)."
* Google may effectively expect women to perpetuate the circumstances holding them back. [link](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/06/one-question-google-uses-to-predict-the-success-of-its-male-and-female-job-candidates.html)
* Women on public radio are routinely criticized for having the wrong voice, though men using the same vocal techniques receive no such pushback. [link](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/07/female-voice-anxiety-c-v-r.html)
* Kudos to Massachusetts for making it illegal to ask a job candidate's current salary, which tends to perpetuate pay inequality. [link](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/business/dealbook/wage-gap-massachusetts-law-salary-history.html)
* Companies who take the most basic steps to examine whether they are paying women equally immediately find out they aren't. The implication is that most companies haven't bothered to ask, or, if they have, don't feel the need to do anything about it. [link](http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-there-is-no-science-in-your-salary-1470153316).
* Expense policies cover stuff that men need, but not things that women need, and companies ask employees to do things that are hard for women and easy for men. Translation: companies care about things that men care about, one reason it's important to [prioritize diversity early](/blog/2016/04/18/why-prioritize-diversity-now/). [link](https://medium.com/stop-drop-scroll/expense-policies-are-a-womans-problem-6c0a0c9110d2)
* Masculinity is *the* common thread in all of the mass shootings in the US recently. What is masculinity supposed to mean, anyway? [link](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-man)

### How Could I Forget?

I'd like to close with one of the truly eye-opening moments I've had in the last
five years.

When I quoted Paul Graham once in
an [inspirational tweet](/blog/2016/01/09/daily-inspiration-experiment/), I
heard from some women who think he's pretty sexist. I asked for clarification
and was directed to read the second footnote on one of his [essays about
founding a company](http://paulgraham.com/start.html):

> One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are
> no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be
> reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was
> likely to have them soon. But you're not allowed to ask prospective employees
> if they plan to have kids soon.

I felt like I saw both sides of this, but when I asked my wife, she almost burst out
laughing. "Of course he's a sexist A-hole," she said. "Why does he assume that
only women are likely to have children soon, or that if a male founder has small
children it won't impact his performance?" She reminded me that when I left my
job to found VividCortex, we had infant twins and we made
the decision *together.*

How could I have overlooked this first-hand life experience while reading Paul
Graham's words? It's because I'm a male in a male-dominated societal structure,
so what I experience moment to moment as "neutral and unbiased" is actually
steeply slanted. It's like I grew up on a hillside, one leg longer
than the other one. I don't notice it until I turn around 180&deg;.

That's why only/mostly women share this type of stuff with me, because men don't
*have* to be conscious of it.

### Thank You

To all the women who've helped me learn to think more about your point of view:
thank you. I know I've been quite the difficult case sometimes. I know it's
exhausting and sometimes dangerous for you to continually try to educate men
such as me. I would like to think I'm getting better and that I'm helping
sometimes instead of just being a burden. To the extent I am, it's your success,
not mine.

*Repeated Disclaimer: I'm not saying that men don't care or talk about these
types of things. In fact, many of the episodes of sexism above came to me
through a man's Twitter post. BUT WOMEN RETWEETED IT TO ME.*
