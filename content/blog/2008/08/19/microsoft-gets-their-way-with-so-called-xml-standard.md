It has all played itself out according to Microsoft's wishes. They have railroaded through a [so-called standard for document representation](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45515), gotten it rubber-stamped by so-called standards bodies, and fought their way past all the [objections of sensible people and companies](http://www.odfalliance.org/resources/Google%20XML%20Q%20%20A%20(2).pdf). In the process, lots of [developing nations have been steamrolled](http://homembit.com/2008/08/openxml-end-of-story-appeals-rejected.html), too. Shame, shame, shame.
