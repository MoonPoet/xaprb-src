I'm at the [MySQL Conference](http://www.mysqlconf.com/) and the t-shirts I created for [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/) have arrived. Come get yours! They are high-quality, attractive shirts you'll be proud to wear, and they are a nice rich wine-red color.

[Harrison Fisk (co-author of MySQL Clustering)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672328550?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=xaprb-20&#038;linkCode=xm2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creativeASIN=0672328550) got the first one, because he told me that he recommends Maatkit to MySQL Support customers about twice a week. I made sure to save one for [Jay Pipes](http://jpipes.com/) too, because his luggage got lost so he has nothing to wear. Unfortunately, I didn't make any Maatkit underwear, sorry Jay. Now I know what to do for next year...

I've already given out a whole bunch of them, and at this rate all 50 of them might not last the day!
