In my opinion, [OpenSQL Camp 2008](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/) was a great success. ([Give your opinion](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/Feedback) too.) I have to spend the next couple of days catching up on other things that have gotten delayed, but will try to write more about the experience later. In the meantime, I want to give a heartfelt thanks to all the people who helped before and during the event---there was a lot of work to be done and people Just Did It. Also, thanks to the [speakers](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/Sessions) and [sponsors](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/Sponsors)!
