I just wrote about how [Maatkit has gotten some new features](/blog/2008/10/04/how-to-check-mysql-replication-integrity-continually/) for helping people make sure their slaves have an exact copy of the master's data. This work was largely sponsored by one of [Percona](http://www.percona.com/)'s customers, whose name I have permission to mention: [Vantage Media](http://www.vantagemedia.com/).

Thanks Vantage! Your sponsorship helps many people and businesses.
