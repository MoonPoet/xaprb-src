The soft registration deadline for [OpenSQL Camp 2008](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/) has passed now; [you can still attend](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/AttendeeList), but you won't be counted into meals and t-shirts. Meanwhile, we have 90 registered attendees, and a [truly impressive set of sessions](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/Schedule) from [heavy hitters in the database world](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/Sessions). This conference is turning into the event I always wanted to attend.

A big thanks to [Sheeri](http://sheeri.com/) and others who kept the wheels turning while I was traveling recently.
