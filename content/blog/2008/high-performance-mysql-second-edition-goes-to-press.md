Today [High Performance MySQL, Second Edition]({{< amz 1449314287 >}}) went to press. I've been working with the production team over the last couple of weeks, proofreading and checking the index and working with the artist who re-drew the illustrations.

I spoke to the production editor this morning and she told me the schedule is for the bound-book date to be the 16th of June. The official in-stock date is June 19th. I don't know how many copies they're printing for the first printing. But I think there have been a lot of pre-orders (rumors I've heard from my Amazon Affiliate account).
I cannot wait to hold my copy in my hands!
