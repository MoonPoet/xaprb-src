I follow only a few comics in my feed reader: [Get Fuzzy](http://www.comics.com/comics/getfuzzy/), [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com/), [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com/), and now [The Adventures of Ace, DBA](http://www.orcldba.com/ace/). It's kind of XKCD-ish, only it's about Oracle and it doesn't have the extra punch line when you hover your mouse over the picture. And it's proof that a DBMS (even one I don't use) can be pretty damn funny.
