I bought a [Mighty Vibe]({{< amz B07KJZJG7H >}}), which is like an iPod Shuffle for Spotify.
It's a small, simple, easy-to-use music player that downloads music from your Spotify account and frees you from your phone.
It supports wired and Bluetooth headphones.
In my testing it's easy to set up, works well, and sounds great.
It's much nicer than the mp3 players I've bought to let my children listen to music.

The picture above shows you virtually everything there is to know about the [Mighty Vibe](https://bemighty.com/).
It has a few simple buttons and a headphone jack.
You install an app on your smartphone, connect to it via Bluetooth, authorize Spotify (you need Spotify Premium, which supports offline mode), and pick playlists to sync to the Mighty.
Mighty then connects to your wifi network and downloads the playlists from Spotify.
It acts as one of your offline devices for your Spotify account.

Installation, setup, and syncing music worked flawlessly for me.
I set the option for the Mighty to sync songs in high-quality format.
It's not the default, and Mighty warns that it might not work as well with Bluetooth, but I wanted to test the quality of the sound.
Once the music was synced to the Mighty, I plugged in my Sennheiser HD650 headphones, and listened.
On challenging tracks like David Gray's *Refugee*, the Mighty performed very well.
I was equally happy with Jann Arden's *Sleepless*, another track I know intimately.

To play, you just press the Play button.
You can switch between playlists with a single click of a button, and voiceover announces the playlist name.

I used the Mighty mobile app to pair my AirPod headphones to the Mighty and it worked flawlessly.

The Mighty Vibe is much more convenient than the mp3 player I've purchased in the past to load songs onto.
When my children ask me about a song we're listening to on Spotify, I can't just sync it to the mp3 player.
I have to purchase it, if I don't own it, and then use my laptop to sync it to the mp3 player by plugging it in via USB.
The Mighty Vibe experience is much better: just add that tune to a playlist and let it sync.
Mighty Vibe supports scheduled sync every day automatically in the background, so that's a cinch.

Compared to the iPod Shuffle that I used to own (is it still in a box somewhere?), the Mighty Vibe is simpler and easier because it supports Spotify so smoothly, and has much better sound quality (the iPod wouldn't accept anything higher than 128kbps audio, which sounded terrible on songs like *Refugee*).

On the downside,

* It's plastic instead of the solid aluminum of the iPod. Despite this it doesn't feel cheap, and Mighty says it's water and shock resistant.
* It's slightly thicker, although about the same width and height.
* It takes a few seconds to boot up after being turned off. I don't remember how fast the iPod started.
* It has an LED that blinks to show it's turned on, and this is quite bright if you're listening in the dark.

Overall, I love it and would recommend it without hesitation.
