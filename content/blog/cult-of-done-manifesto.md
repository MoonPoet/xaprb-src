A dear friend of mine introduced me to the [Cult of Done Manifesto](http://www.manifestoproject.it/bre-pettis-and-kio-stark/) a few years back, perhaps in 2014 or so.
I was so taken by its clarity that I ordered a poster of it and had it mounted on foam board.
I've had it on my wall ever since, next to the desk where I work.

The Manifesto has thirteen brilliant principles that each speak so directly to me that I feel as if the authors knew me and knew what I needed.
But the Cult of Done Manifesto is more than an articulation of principles of focus.
The story of how it was created is inspirational, too.
One of the authors, Bre Pettis, [wrote](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13) about writing the Manifesto itself.
The two coauthors wrote the Manifesto in 20 minutes flat because that's all the time they had.
*Is it possible that this is why it's so damn good?*

### The Cult of Done Manifesto

Bre Pettis and Kio Stark

1. There are three states of being.
   Not knowing, action and completion.
1. Accept that everything is a draft.
   It helps to get done.
1. There is no editing stage.
1. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.
1. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
1. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
1. Once you’re done you can throw it away.
1. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done. 
1. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
1. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
1. Destruction is a variant of done. 
1. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
1. Done is the engine of more.

I don't know if you still can, but you used to be able to purchase this glorious poster of it.
This is the one I have next to my desk.
