I have a deliberate strategy that guides who I follow on Twitter, and the tools and techniques I use to curate my feed. I'm not sure how unusual it is; perhaps many of us do the same types of things but don't share our thinking with each other. I wrote this post in case my thinking is useful to others.

<!--more-->

My goal on Twitter is to broaden my horizons and help me to see the world
through other peoples' eyes. I explicitly do _not_ use Twitter to learn about what's happening in the world, stay in touch with friends and family, share photos, or discover articles or other content.
I value control over what I consume, and I value quality over quantity.

To achieve that goal, I balance carefully whom I follow and how, to create a high signal-to-noise ratio in my feed. This article is a set of principles and opinions I've developed over time, some fundamental and some in response to circumstances that arise.

First, my choices related to _whom_ I follow and how:

* **Follow thoughtful people.** I unfollow people who share content without taking a moment to ask if it's real, intelligent, kind, and verifiable. I'll give some examples in a later article of the type of sharing that makes me unfollow people. A random example of a person whose sharing has a superb signal-to-noise ratio is [Manisha Agarwal](https://twitter.com/manisha72617183).
* **Follow no more than 100 people.** I set an arbitrary limit of 100 after experimenting to see how much content people share. This forces me to prioritize. For example, it meant that I unfollowed some smart and worthwhile white people to make room for people of color.
* **Following isn't friendship.** I don't feel obligated to follow my friends. My priority is the content that people share, and the quality of content is only loosely correlated to whether I know someone. I want to listen outside my bubble, and if I follow my friends they'll drown out the other voices. Many of my dearest friends aren't on my following list. Choosing to use Twitter as a window to the world, and to disregard any sense of obligation to send social signals with it, is liberating.
* **Don't follow popular people.** Popular people have a lot of followers. I'll hear their best work secondhand.
* **Don't follow prolific tweeters.** I've learned a lot from people such as @jasonlk and @girlziplocked, but I don't need to follow them to do it. Again, their followers will retweet their best. Extremely prolific tweeters can be interesting to follow for a while, but when I start to feel a sense of exhaustion, I just unfollow them.
* **Unfollow people who tell me what I already know.** I don't need my biases and beliefs reinforced by others. I do that well enough on my own. This inherently means that Twitter isn't "comfort food" for me to read. It means I'm curating an experience that's at least slightly disconcerting, which is good.
* **Turn off retweets sometimes.** Sometimes I find a person whose perspective
  is interesting, but their interest in something like a celebrity, or their
  support of their employer, isn't. I can get the best of their original
  thoughts by disabling retweets and just looking at what they write themselves.
  I'd say I've disabled retweets from a third or more of the people I follow.
* **Follow more women.** I live in a patriarchy. Men hold most of the positions of power and influence. A lot of what they think and say comes from a place of bias and privilege and isn't nearly as interesting, true, or valid as what women tweet. Listening to [what women say](/blog/what-women-tell-me/) has changed my perspectives significantly. If powerful, privileged men say worthwhile things, women are a great filter to pass it along to me through retweets. But if I listen to what men think about themselves, I hear delusions of grandeur and righteousness.
* **Follow more minorities and nontraditional identities.** Following people who
  adhere to different religions, people of color, trans people, and people from
  different worlds (not people in tech who live in America, for example) is
  great. I still get the bias that I'm following people who, like me, have
  access to Twitter. But there's no way for me to escape all biases.
* **Follow mostly individual accounts.** I follow a few non-person accounts to introduce variety; for example, I follow @tiny_star_field to sprinkle little pictures into my feed and break up the monotony of text. But I don't follow many non-person accounts that rate dogs or tweet out emergency kitten pictures. I follow enough people with cute pets already.
* **Follow some people for specific topics.** I follow a limited number of
  people who specialize in topics I'd like a little bit of.

I've seen various counterpoints to these principles as time has passed. For example, someone tweeted me to tell me I could follow my friends but mute them. That way, presumably, I wouldn't feel guilty or risk offending my friends by not following them. I disagree; first of all, where does one draw the line at who's enough of a friend to follow? There's no right answer if following is about friendship and trying to make someone feel good about themselves, so I choose not to do that. Secondly, if I mute them, I won't see _any_ of their tweets,
which isn't what I want.  It's better to unfollow and rely on mutual friends to
retweet their best to me. Again: I believe following is much better used as a
curation and filtering mechanism. Trying to intersect that with a social
signal is a losing game.

Another person agreed with my "follow more women" advice, and said he tries to
follow roughly the same number of men as women. But he misunderstood me. I don't
try to do that.  Women don't get an equal voice in our society.  I need to
follow _far more women than men_ to equalize their voices to the level they
should be at. Check who I follow and see. If you're having trouble figuring out
how to follow more women who deserve to be heard, perhaps start with a list
[such as this](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/743111992131493888) and
go from there.

Here's an example of why putting into action many of the points I've made thus
far is working well for me. Someone once tweeted "I wish following was a
spectrum, so I could follow @pmarca at 25% and get only his top-quartile
tweets." Well, here's some unsolicited advice: if you unfollow him and follow
thoughtful people who will retweet his best, you'll get that. But in this
specific example, because @pmarca is actually not a nice person at all, what
you'll get instead is an education on why a lot of what he tweets is narcissism
and hatred. You'll get your perspective changed. That's what you should want,
instead of the top 25% of his most skillfully-worded bigotry. Forgive me for
being opinionated, I guess?

It's not all about who I follow: it's also about _how_. There's a number
of technological and other factors at play (such as political and business
interests), and I need to negotiate these with care. Here's how I do that:

* **Use Twitter.** Twitter is inherently more open and egalitarian than other
  social media networks, which don't encourage third-party client software that
  might present a different perspective than the one they think they can make
  the most money from. It's definitely the best (lesser of the evils?) of the
  major networks.
* **Don't use Twitter's client.** Twitter's algorithmic choices are not for me.
  I want to choose my own timeline, not let algorithms do it for me. Algorithms
  are genuinely dangerous to human society, as we've seen over the last several
  years. I believe it is my individual responsibility to curate my timeline
  carefully. I cannot surrender this to a machine. Third-party clients ignore
  Twitter's algorithm and present the full, unmanipulated feed of content. Or at
  least I think they do. They also don't show Twitter's ads. Sometimes I wonder
  how long Twitter will permit this. I hope they continue to.
* **Use a sophisticated client with filtering.** Clients such as Tweetbot (on
  Mac and iOS) or Flamingo (on Android) let you do things like muting a
  particular client by viewing the tweet's details and clicking or tapping on
  the client software that sent the tweet:
  ![Muting](/media/2018/04/muting.png)
  I've muted a bunch of clients like Untappd, SumAll, instagram, LinkedIn,
  nuzzel, and the dozens of client applications that companies use to
  automatically blast content onto social media. This significantly improves my
  signal-to-noise ratio.  You can also mute keywords. I find it useful to mute
  political words, for example; I get my political news elsewhere. Here's some
  of my keyword mute filters in Tweetbot:
  ![Muted Keywords](/media/2018/04/muted-keywords.png) The first keyword is a regular expression that mutes tweets with too many hashtags; the others mute things I find are noisy or stressful. Muting political hot-button content keeps some of the shouting out of my timeline.

This sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it! It is, but it's my responsibility.
And it works: I no longer lack control over what I read. (Or at least I have the
illusion of control). Put another way: I completely empathize with this tweet
from Asya:

> [Asya](https://twitter.com/asya999/status/982939664964378624)
>
> Dear @Twitter  I follow more than 700 people.  That means I want to see what *they* share in my timeline and not what some people I don't follow (but they happen to follow) share. If what those people share is so cool, my friends will retweet it and I'll see it then. Thx.

The solution I found to that problem is purely technical, because the problem is
purely technical. If I couldn't use Tweetbot or something equivalent, I'd just
stop reading Twitter. (I'd probably continue writing on it, though.)

Why go to all this trouble myself, instead of letting Twitter's algorithms do it
for me? Isn't that what Big Data and Machine Learning is for? Ostensibly, yes,
but as we've seen, **absolutely no**. There's a deeper point here: I either take
responsibility for my own consumption and learning, or I abdicate it to
machines. And I believe that abdication to machines is amongst the most pressing
dangers facing our society today. We have a President that was elected by
foreign powers who figured out how to manipulate millions of people through the
algorithms that they allowed to control what they see, hear, and believe.

Those algorithms are built and influenced by the inexorable demands of the
company's business model. I think the company is mostly helpless to understand,
let alone overcome, the vulnerabilities to which their business model exposes
them.  If this doesn't scare you, maybe it should.

My solution to this is purely non-technical: I built my own algorithm, so to
speak, by following people with sound judgment, and a variety of experiences and
worldviews. It's old-fashioned, but I think it's better than the new-fangled
technologically generated news feeds that dominate the Internet today.
