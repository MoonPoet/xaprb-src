Last week I [spoke](/talks/) at SRECon about how systems behave when they're
stressed to the point of reaching their limits. Interestingly, I was near my
personal limits at this point. Nothing dramatic: just travel, sleep deficit, jet
lag, and impatience with a project I'm working on.  Even as I spoke about
observing systems, I was observing my own behavior and seeing evidence that I
needed to ease up a bit.

I noticed myself not being quite at top performance in a few relatively minor
ways. The most obvious was when I tried to inject some humor into conversations
off-the-cuff, without thinking about it first. This happened at a lunch
conversation, where I started to crack a joke involving current events. I did a
similar thing while presenting: I started to joke about LinkedIn, realized it
wasn't going anywhere and wasn't funny, and moved on so as not to distract
further from the talk.

These were opportunities for me to notice my behavior and take a step back, just
be myself, just be normal. I wasn't quite being normal, I was trying to be
something slightly more than normal. I was being witty to seek attention, and
that never works for me. I was able to examine this in
[meditation](/blog/how-i-meditate/), get in touch with what was going on, and
let go of it.

It was a good reminder that when I am using all my reserves of energy and sleep,
I have no buffer to cope with the small additional things that crop up.
