I use Google Docs and Google Sheets a *lot*. At some point I found quick-URLs
that will create a new document and spreadsheet from a bookmark. _Update: you
can also just type doc.new, sheet.new, etc into your browser's address bar._

<!--more-->

I use these to start a new document and start typing notes while doing a 1:1 or
in a meeting, or when I need a scratchpad, or when I'm taking some text or notes
from somewhere and putting it into my Drive for archiving.

(I keep my personal and business documents and notes separate, so my personal
Google Drive folder has YYYY-MM date-organized folders of all my past work that
isn't shared with anyone.)

Here's the shortcuts you can bookmark or drag to your bookmarks bar:

* [New Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/create)
* [New Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/create)

These have "user zero" encoded in the URL, which assumes you want to create a
new document under the first Google account you're signed into. If you want a
different one you'll need to edit the URL to contain `.../u/1/create` or
similar.

I found that other shortcut URLs work too, with a little trial-and-error:

* [New Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/create)

I'm sure you can figure out one that will work for a Form or Drawing too. But I
only use Doc and Sheet shortcuts myself.
