I've occasionally needed to extract text and/or images from a PDF. I've found a
couple of easy, free ways to do this on MacOS.

There's commercial software such as Adobe Acrobat that will extract images from
a PDF, of course, but there's an easier way: a free application called [The
Unarchiver][unarchiver] that treats a PDF file as if it were a zip file and
extracts everything into a folder. Just install the app, then right-click on
a PDF file and select *Open With*.

Related pro-tip: if you want to extract all the images from a Keynote
presentation, you can simply unzip the presentation using the commandline
`unzip` application. It'll expand into a folder that contains all the images and
other assets. (Or you can right-click and open with the Archive Utility app.)

Mission accomplished, but you'll probably have a bunch of `.tiff` files where
you want compact `.jpg` or compressed `.png` files instead. If you're a
commandline user, and you have ImageMagick installed, you can convert them all
at once with a Bash variable substitution like this:

```
find . -name '*.tiff' | while read line; do
   convert "$line" "${line%%tiff}jpg"
done
```

That'll do the trick for the images. For the text, you can just open the PDF in
Mac's default PDF viewer, the Preview app. Use Cmd-A to select all of the text
and other content, and then you can simply paste it into any plaintext
destination. If you don't have a favorite text editor such as Atom or Sublime
Text, you can use Mac's default TextEdit app. Just use *Format > Make Plain
Text* to set it to plaintext mode.
