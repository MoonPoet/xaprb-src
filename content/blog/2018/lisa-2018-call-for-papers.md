The [LISA18 Call for
Participation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa18/call-for-participation)
is open. I'm on the session review committee this year, and I encourage you to
propose a talk. If I can help with your talk, I encourage you to
[ask](https://twitter.com/xaprb) me; if I'm not able to help myself, I can be a
liaison to the person who could help you do your best work.

I'm personally very excited about this event, which is why I've made a big time
commitment to it. I attended and spoke last year and it *felt like home* to me:

- It's a practitioner's event; everyone there has worked hard and is sharing
  what they've learned.
- It's vendor-neutral, so there are exhibitors, but their talks aren't sneaked
  into the program like other conferences do.
- It's diverse and I saw a lot of great talks by people who aren't the typical
  ones I see at all the conferences I go to.
- All of the content is free and openly available; the talks are recorded and
  are on YouTube, not behind a paywall.

The conference's self-description is

> conference for operations professionals, where sysadmins, systems engineers, IT operations professionals, SRE practitioners, developers, IT managers, and academic researchers share real-world knowledge

It's a really good event if that description resonates with work you've done.
Not sure? Check out the [2017 program](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program). A few of the talks, selected almost at random: [The 7 Deadly Sins of Documentation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/blackwell),  [Stories from the Trenches of Government Technology](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/presentation/cutts), [Your Secrets in Cloud-Based Key Management Services](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/oboyle), and [ChatOps at Shopify: Inviting Bots in Our Day-to-Day Operations](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/niyonkuru).

One of the things I feel most passionately about is sharing what I do and
encouraging others to develop their own ability to share. We all have a
contribution to make and we all can make an impact in other peoples' lives by
speaking and sharing. It is not easy to get started, but LISA is a great first
event to speak at, and there's all the support you could wish to make it as
easy as it can be.

And if you're an experienced speaker, of course we want to hear from you too. Please [propose a talk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa18/call-for-participation) and I hope to meet you there.
