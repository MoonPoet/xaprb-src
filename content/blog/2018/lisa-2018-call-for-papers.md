The [LISA18 Call for
Participation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa18/call-for-participation)
is open. I'm on the session review committee this year, and I encourage you to
propose a talk. If I can help with your talk, I encourage you to
[ask](https://twitter.com/xaprb) me; if I'm not able to help myself, I can be a
liaison to the person who could help you do your best work.

I'm personally very excited about this event, which is why I've made a big time
commitment to it. I attended and spoke last year and it *felt like home* to me:

- It's a practitioner's event; everyone there has worked hard and is sharing
  what they've learned.
- It's vendor-neutral, so there are exhibitors, but their talks aren't sneaked
  into the program like other conferences do.
- It's diverse and I saw a lot of great talks by people who aren't the typical
  ones I see at all the conferences I go to.
- All of the content is free and openly available; the talks are recorded and
  are on YouTube, not behind a paywall.

The conference's self-description is

> conference for operations professionals, where sysadmins, systems engineers, IT operations professionals, SRE practitioners, developers, IT managers, and academic researchers share real-world knowledge

It's a really good event if that description resonates with work you've done.
Not sure? Check out the [2017 program](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program). A few of the talks, selected almost at random: [The 7 Deadly Sins of Documentation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/blackwell),  [Stories from the Trenches of Government Technology](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/presentation/cutts), [Your Secrets in Cloud-Based Key Management Services](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/oboyle), and [ChatOps at Shopify: Inviting Bots in Our Day-to-Day Operations](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/niyonkuru).

One of the things I feel most passionately about is sharing what I do and
encouraging others to develop their own ability to share. We all have a
contribution to make and we all can make an impact in other peoples' lives by
speaking and sharing. It is not easy to get started, but LISA is a great first
event to speak at, and there's all the support you could wish to make it as
easy as it can be.

> LISA 2017 was my first ever conference speaking gig. It was awesome and the environment was fun, inclusive and I made friends! If you are thinking of speaking and are from an URM... this is a good event.
