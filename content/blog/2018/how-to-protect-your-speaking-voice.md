Losing your voice is an incredibly painful, frustrating, and debilitating
experience.  I've lost my voice a few times at conferences, especially in the
first couple of years when I was new to the scene and wasn't aware of how all
the stresses could overwhelm me. I'm not a professional, but I've learned a few
things, tried some other things, and haven't had trouble with my voice for many
years. Here's what works for me.

First, recognize the stresses a conference can place on your ability to speak:

- You likely flew to the conference in an airplane, which is a very dry
  environment.
- You're probably off your normal sleep, exercise, eating, and drinking
  schedule.
- You may be exposed to smoke, for example if the conference is in Las Vegas.
- You're potentially drinking alcohol.
- You're probably spending time in loud places where you're trying to be heard
  over lots of people, such as at an expo hall or a cocktail reception.
- You're nervous about performance, such as the presentation you're going to
  give, and your overall stress and tension is high.

All of these factors can contribute[^doctor] to laryngitis, which can range from
mild soreness and hoarseness to complete loss of the ability to make any noise
above a whisper. And this can take days or even weeks to recover.

Here's what I have learned to do:

- Stay out of loud places. If I'm in a loud place, I do not try to compete with
  the volume around me. I get out if I can. If there is a factor that's
  encouraging loudness, I try to mitigate that.[^dj]
- I'm very careful with irritants such as coffee, secondary smoke, and alcohol.
- I hydrate to compensate for the dryness of the plane and/or the air at the
  destination. If my lips feel dry, I know I'm stressing my throat, and I'm more
  careful.
- I drink some warm herbal tea with lemon and honey. A stressed throat starts to
  generate mucus. Clearing my throat and coughing is additional stress. The
  lemon and honey help me reduce the amount of phlegm I need to clear, avoiding
  some of that stress. Similarly, I avoid drinking milk, which causes mucus
  production in the throat; and I basically don't like coffee unless it has
  milk, so that's another reason not to overdo the coffee.

I've learned that saliva is what moisturizes and soothes the throat, and staying
hydrated prevents a dry mouth, which prevents a dry throat. I want my throat to
stay in the middle ground between excess moistness and dryness.

I've also learned not to go to conferences where I can't avoid things that make
me ill. I do not go to Las Vegas. I have never been able to avoid secondary
smoke there, no matter what measures I've taken. Even the hotel elevators, even
at expensive hotels, even when I get a nonsmoking room, have cigarette smoke in
them. It's horrible. No more Vegas.

Above all, I try to talk less, and more quietly. By the time I've noticed that
I'm getting hoarse, it may be too late: I've gone to bed slightly hoarse and
woken up completely mute. I've learned to take this very seriously and not push
my limits.
  
[^doctor]: I am not a doctor and this blog post is not medical advice.

[^dj]: If you've seen me go to the conference organizer and ask them to turn the music down in the expo hall, that's me putting this advice into action.  Hundreds of people competing to be heard over a DJ is just a downward spiral.
