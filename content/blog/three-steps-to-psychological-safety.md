Psychological safety has become a prominent part of the modern engineering lexicon, as reports and stories from Google have made the rounds. Google found that the strongest predictor of high achievement is psychological safety. This one factor apparently trumps all other reasons that a team can perform well.

I have my own take on what psychological safety requires, based on personal experience in my closest relationships. I've found that in order to trust others, I must first feel acknowledged, validated, and supported. Here's how I try to do that.

I learned this while working on one particular relationship. Someone helped me see my partner in a new light by asking me to take the time to assure them of three things:

1. *I hear you*. By listening, and making sure they know I'm listening, I am actually validating that they exist. Everyone wants to know that they exist to others. This is why the "silent treatment" is such a cruel punishment for children.
2. *I care*. By making it clear that I care about what they're experiencing, I'm saying that their existence and experiences matter to me. We all want to matter to others.
3. *I've got your back.* Not only do I acknowledge you and care about you, but I'll support you. I'll be there if you need me.

So simple---and yet so powerful. What possibilities could this open in your life?
