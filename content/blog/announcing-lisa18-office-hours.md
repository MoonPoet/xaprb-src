There will be online "office hours" with the LISA organizing committee on Thursday May 17th, at 12-1pm PST. Anyone is welcome to join and discuss possible conference speaking proposals.

<!--more-->

Here's what the organizing committee can help you with:

- Brainstorm ideas
- Editing and feedback
- Talk about the audience/community

You can join over Slack or IRC:

- Slack: USENIX-LISA workspace, channel #lisa18cfp (join this workspace via http://lisainvite.herokuapp.com/ )
- IRC: Freenode, channel #lisa18cfp (webchat is available https://webchat.freenode.net/ )

If you would like to discuss proposals with us but are unable to make this time, feel free to ask questions in those channels and we will respond when we can, or contact us at lisa18chairs@usenix.org.

Our past speakers say that speaking at LISA is a valuable experience. They found it rewarding to share their knowledge and experience with the audience, connect with others, and many have said that it provided tangible benefits to their career and personal development as well. Even if you haven't spoken at a conference before, you can do it, and we can help you. The central idea is to share a story or experience with the audience. It's that simple!
