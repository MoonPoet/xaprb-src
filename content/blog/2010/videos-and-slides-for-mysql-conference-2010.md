Sheeri has posted an awesome [list of talks with links to videos and slides](http://www.pythian.com/news/11211/2010-oreilly-mysql-conference-slides-and-videos/) from the MySQL conference. She did a lot of the video recording herself. I don't know how she could have posted them so fast---it's a lot of work.
