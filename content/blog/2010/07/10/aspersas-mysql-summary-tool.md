For those of you who miss what [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/)'s mk-audit tool (now retired) gave you, there's a pair of tools in [Aspersa](http://code.google.com/p/aspersa/) that more than replaces it. [I wrote previously about the summary tool](/blog/2010/05/16/apsersas-summary-tool-supports-adaptec-and-megaraid-controllers/). I don't think I have mentioned the mysql-summary tool. It has been under development for a while, and at this point it has quite a lot of functionality. You can see a [sample of the output on its manual page](http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/html/mysql-summary.html).
