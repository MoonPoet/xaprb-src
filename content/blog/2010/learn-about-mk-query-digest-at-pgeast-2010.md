I'll be attending [PgEast](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/) this year, as I've done for the last couple of years, and this year I'll also be speaking. The topic is [query analysis with mk-query-digest](http://postgresqlconference.org/2010/east/talks/query/analysis_with_mk_query_digest). The official description of my talk is as follows:

> mk-query-digest is a powerful open-source tool for capturing, filtering, transforming, and aggregating queries, with the ability to do all sorts of other advanced tasks too. By default, it aggregates similar queries together and presents a designed-for-DBAs report with statistics about the most important queries, so you can see where to focus your optimization efforts. This talk shows you how to use mk-query-digest to analyze your Postgres server's workload.

[PgEast 2010 has an impressive lineup of talks](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/2010/east/talks), which isn't even complete yet. I've thoroughly enjoyed this conference [in](/blog/2009/04/05/postgresql-conference-east-2009-day-three/) [the](/blog/2009/04/04/postgresql-conference-east-2009-day-two/) [past](/blog/2008/04/01/postgresql-conference-east-2008/), and it looks like this year will be better than ever.
