I've started [an HTML manual for innotop](http://innotop.googlecode.com/svn/html/index.html), a "top" clone for MySQL. It includes [screenshots](http://innotop.googlecode.com/svn/html/screenshots.html). Right now I only have screenshots for the new U mode, which demonstrates how the [User Statistics enhancements in Percona Server](http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/percona-server:features:userstatv2) can show you which tables and indexes are most used.
