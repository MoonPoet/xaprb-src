I'm speaking at the [O'Reilly MySQL Conference 2010](http://conferences.oreilly.com/mysql). I hope I don't lose my voice, because I have four sessions!

*   [Diagnosing and Fixing MySQL Performance Problems](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12410)
*   [EXPLAIN Demystified](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12474)
*   [Read-Write Splitting: Techniques, Challenges, and Solutions](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12479)
*   [MySQL Graphing and Trending with Cacti](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12477)

You can click through on the links above to learn more about each session. I'm also looking forward to the other sessions. Here's a sample of a few that I have my eye on:

*   [Linux performance tuning and stabilization tips](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/13252) by Yoshinori Matsunobu
*   [MySQL Proxy meets: Memcache](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/13335) by Jan Kneschke
*   [PHP Object-Relational Mapping Libraries In Action](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12489) by Fernando Ipar

The schedule is far from complete, because the conference committee is still working on it, but the proposals to choose from are impressive. Stay tuned as more talks are approved and the schedule fills out, and don't wait too long to register and book your flight! This is going to be a banner year.
