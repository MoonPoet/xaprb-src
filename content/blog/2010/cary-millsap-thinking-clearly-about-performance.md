[Cary Millsap](http://method-r.com/) has a [concise, readable paper on performance](http://method-r.com/downloads/doc_details/44-thinking-clearly-about-performance). Anyone involved in database performance optimization should read it. Cary's writing has heavily influenced the [mk-query-digest](http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-query-digest.html) tool for analyzing MySQL/PostgreSQL/Memcached/HTTP query performance, and I think you'll get a lot more from mk-query-digest if you read this paper -- and you should also read his book, [reviewed here](/blog/2009/11/07/a-review-of-optimizing-oracle-performance-by-cary-millsap/). It's one of the top books on my [Essential Books List](/blog/essential-books/).
