InfiniDB has [a sensible Enterprise/Community release process](http://infinidb.org/infinidb-blog/care-and-feeding-of-infinidb.html), which seems similar to what [I suggested for MySQL](/blog/2007/08/12/what-would-make-me-buy-mysql-enterprise/). Its simplicity also stands in stark contrast to [MySQL's new release policy](http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Development_Cycle), which is hard to understand and has been [confusing people](http://antbits.blogspot.com/2009/12/version-number-5-point-wtf.html).
