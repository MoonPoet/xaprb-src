I'll be helping [Morgan Tocker](http://www.percona.com/team/morgan-tocker.html) deliver the second half of his [training course for MySQL Developers/DBAs in New York City](http://percona-ny-nyc-rss.eventbrite.com/) in a few days ([more Percona training](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/01/14/2010-percona-training-schedule/)). It was a snap decision at the last minute, but I'm hoping I'll still get to meet some folks there. If we've corresponded over email or blog comments and you would like to get together, ping me in the comments here!

If you're in the New York City area and you use MySQL, you should consider attending this course, too. Morgan knows his stuff and has written a good curriculum. Attendees give his courses excellent feedback, and the price is very reasonable. Oh, and I'll be there too, did I mention that? You can pick my brain, no extra charge. Bring organic free-trade chocolate to assist with extra-tough questions.
