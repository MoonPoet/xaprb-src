Over the last few years I have learned this lesson many times over: You can keep
your high performing team members, or your low performers, but not both.

<!--more-->

Not everyone belongs in every team, and the difference between high and low
performers is quite large.  But it is uncomfortable to address underperforming
team members, even when it's obvious that someone is not working out and will
not be able to change. Most managers would prefer not to deal with the situation
directly, for a variety of reasons such as:

- They believe that having *someone* in the position is better than an empty
  seat.[^1]
- They know that hiring is a lot of work and they don't want to do it.
- They hope things will get better magically.

As a result of keeping bad performers, they lose good ones, because eagles don't
fly with turkeys. When a high performing team member sees the situation not
being addressed, almost nothing is more demoralizing.

Worse: low-performers sometimes get put into positions where they can hire. And
another law I've never seen violated is this: A-players hire A-players because
they want to surround themselves with high performers; B-players hire C-players
because they want to make themselves look good. Keep a lower-performing team
member and you will very soon have a bunch of mediocre hires, and an insane
amount of politics designed to maintain this status quo by making it hard to
figure out what's really going on.

[^1]: This belief is always wrong, regardless of extenuating circumstances.
