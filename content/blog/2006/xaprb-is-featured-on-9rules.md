The [9rules network](http://9rules.com), a trusted filter that chooses the best content on the web, has [named Xaprb as a featured blog](http://9rules.com/en/browse/featured/archive/94/). This means a lot to me. 9rules is a great place to go and find quality content on an Internet that's drowning in garbage, so being featured there is no small matter.

This is a good time for to make a plug for 9rules, too. One great way to stay up-to-date on the best of the web is browse the [communities](http://9rules.com/en/browse/) and find one that has interesting content, then subscribe to the aggregated feed.

If you're not yet [subscribed to Xaprb's content via feeds or email](/index.xml), give that a try too :-)

Finally, thanks for the very kind words, [Kyle](http://warpspire.com/)!
