The slides for my [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop) presentation at the recent [MySQL Conference](http://www.mysqlconf.com/) have been posted, along with other presenter's slides, on the [conference presentations](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/54/presentations.html) page. Love that stock photography!
