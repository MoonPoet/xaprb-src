# DevOps for the Database
## Baron Schwartz &bullet; DevOpsDays Chicago 2019

Most teams find it hard to "do DevOps" in the DB for several reasons. This talk summarizes what I've learned over the last decade, studying teams that succeeded as well as those that tried. I've distilled it all into concrete, practical steps you can take to improve.

Databases are special because they're stateful, and DevOps reflects this: in practice, databases are a lot harder to "DevOps" (as a verb) than other parts of the stack. In this talk you'll learn why Databases are "hard to DevOps," but also why it's valuable enough to keep trying‚ and smarter ways to try. There's some theory/discussion, but not much; there's more focus on case studies, commonalities between lots of teams/companies, and common approaches that I've seen work really well. In more detail,

* What research shows about DevOps, databases, and company performance
* Current and emerging trends in how we build/manage data tiers, and implications
* Elevation of the traditional dedicated DBA role and what's happening as a result
* Driving cultural change towards distributed database competency and responsibility
* Why some teams succeed in this transformation, while others fail
* How to improve your chances of succeeding (or avoiding pitfalls others have already found)

# That One Time I Broke The Internet

???

- Once upon a time I broke a site I was working on.
- I was impressed that the senior devs helped more than the DBAs.
- This is both a good and a bad thing.
- The VP of Engineering called me afterwards and we had a blameless
  conversation.

# What's DevOps _For The Database_?

![Image](unsplash-photos-IzV1d3qJc24.jpg)

The usual suspects:

- Infrastructure-as-code, automation...
- Continuous delivery...
- Et cetera

--

Plus,

- Schema as code
- Automated migrations
- Developer ownership of databases
- Et cetera

---

# Why Databases are Hard to DevOps

1. We delegate state management to them
1. They're not designed for automation
1. Ops tooling isn't designed for stateful services
1. They support high-performance, critical workloads under load

???

- There's very few automation "handles" on a database
- Ops tooling has poor primitives to support complex orchestration, consistency, etc

# Signs of Non-DevOps

![Image](unsplash-photos-yKalliZTaQU.jpg)

- You have misaligned authority and responsibility
	- DBAs are responsible for developer mistakes
	- Devs feel no pain when they hurt the DB
- Devs depend on DBAs to do things for them
- It's scary to do a schema migration

# Defining Database Performance Expectations

I added these slides after giving the talk, at an attendee's suggestion. I have given a variety of talks on how to characterize database performance, health, and quality-of-service. Here I summarize; the following slides add detail.

Database performance can be characterized, constrained, and understood by a combination of:

* External, customer-facing perspective
* Awareness of internal behavior
* Sufficiency and performance of resources the database needs

---
# Workload Quality-of-Service

The *external* perspective on database performance is defined by the user/customer experience. This is unquestionably the most important perspective: the database exists to do useful work for users; they care about correctness and performance, nothing else.

This essentially means quality-of-service of the workload, which is the population of requests the database services.

Quality-of-service is measurable with the CELT golden metrics.

---

# The CELT Golden Metrics

Four metrics fully describe request quality-of-service, derived from and agreeing with formal performance science (e.g. queueing theory).

* Concurrency (load)
* Error rate (user's perception of correctness)
* Latency (user's perception of performance)
* Throughput (request rate)

These are *request* metrics. They are SLIs (service level indicators) that actually *over-describe* performance.

*They apply to the database's overall workload, as well as to each individual type of request/query.*

---

# The USE Golden Metrics

The *internal* view on database performance characterizes how the database's inner workings are behaving, as well as the key operating system resources the database requires to do its work. Components/resources are:

* CPU, Network, I/O or Storage, and Memory
* Database-specific components such as thread pools, caches, locking, etc.

For each of those, Brendan Gregg's USE method provides a helpful way to evaluate:

* Utilization
* Saturation
* Errors

# Fitting Together CELT and USE

The CELT metrics are database SLIs. They enable you to understand how well your database is performing its work, and to set SLOs and SLAs. If there's a performance problem, CELT will reveal it.

The USE metrics are diagnostic and explanatory, not descriptive. They enable you to understand *why* your database is missing its SLOs.

Put another way: users don't know and don't care that your CPU is maxed out. But it's useful, because it explains why users are experiencing high latency, and points you to solutions.

Using CELT+USE together gives you a holistic way to describe, constrain, and diagnose database performance. More detail is available in the reference materials linked later.

# Assessing DevOps Maturity

![Oranges](erwan-hesry-_omuigahLco-unsplash.jpg)

Maturity models are problematic, but:

- Gap analysis is really helpful
- The #ASODR capabilities are useful (p31 of 2019 report)
- Dickerson's hierarchy of reliability
- Database DevOps capabilities from my book (p9-p12)

# Pitfalls To Avoid

![Zebras](pop-zebra-4q3Ogm3Kt44-unsplash.jpg)

- Reliance on brittle/inadequate/naive tooling
- Hoping to import DevOps from a vendor
- Internal resistance
- Unrealistic plans

???
- Resistance can be e.g. a DBA who views it as job security

# How To Start

![Stairs](jukan-tateisi-bJhT_8nbUA0-unsplash.jpg)

- See #ASODR, p30 of 2019 report
- Start somewhere benign---no holes below the waterline
- Doing new things right is easier than rewrites
- Pay attention to culture

---

# Key Capabilities

![Keys](silas-kohler-C1P4wHhQbjM-unsplash.jpg)

1. Baseline CELT metrics per-query
2. Decouple app & code, get CD working
3. Service-aligned full-lifecycle teams

# The DBA's Career Path

![Summit](paula-may-AJqeO_-ifx0-unsplash.jpg)

- The DBA role is being redefined and/or obsoleted
    - But! This is an opportunity, not a threat
    - Every DBA needs to become a DBRE
- Every engineer needs to gain DB proficiency
	- Indexing
	- Query execution plans
	- Performance mindset
	- Basic query-writing skills
