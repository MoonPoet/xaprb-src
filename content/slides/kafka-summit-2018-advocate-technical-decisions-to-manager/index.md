# Stories From The Trenches

At VividCortex, we recently re-evaluated our backend time series datastore.

- I initiated this process

???

* Opening story: trying to PoC the MDB, me operating in old gut-decision mode, team trying to work with me the way we used to work together. But I'd hired a VP of Eng, the old days are gone. The team wasn't clear what I was looking for. They thought I was asking them to evaluate and pick a tech, what I really wanted was for them to make it easy for me to rubberstamp their decision. The VP of Eng had done that for me and I couldn't go back to the old ways.

--
- I didn't realize I was falling back into old habits

--
- I didn't know I was putting the team in a difficult position

--
- They thought I wanted a deep technical evaluation
- They didn't know I wanted a rubber-stamp decision

### You Don't Know It Till You Teach It

Part of what got me in trouble was my "unconscious competence."

???

* I used to do things that I assumed others could do too.
* Just being able to do things doesn't mean you know it.
* You don't know it till you can teach it to others too. That was me.

# Background: What Kinds Of Decisions?

* Prioritize a project
* Buy a product
* Choose a technology
* Change a process or structure

???

So what kinds of decisions are we talking about advocating in this talk?
It's not limited to a specific type. It runs a spectrum.

# Background: Who's Advocating Them?

Anyone who's not authorized to simply make the decision themselves.

???
* It's sales. Core sales skills.

---
# Background: To Whom Are You Advocating?

![Image](unsplash-photos-gNUMZjxd89w.jpg# fr maxw-60pct)

- Your manager
- Their manager
- Your peers

???

---
class: img-right-full
![Image](unsplash-photos-votwQUV9ts4.jpg)

# Background: Why Is It Hard?

- Different perspectives
- Different contexts
- High stakes
- Hope isn't a strategy

???
* Why is it hard for both? Difference in perspective, context
* I've realized that I've made some bad decisions
* Some of what worked out was luck
* The stakes are higher, I want sound reasoning now

---
class: img-left-full

# Things Are Different Now

- My opinions aren't just one person's opinion now
- I'm not available to the team in the same way
- I can't collaborate with the team like I used to
- My involvement is auditing decisions, not making them

???
* But I'm not as accessible as I used to be
* My opinions are law now
* I can't take the time to approach your decision by retracing it, I must test/audit some high points instead
* A lot of people don't know how to approach a problem like this in increasing levels of detail.
---
# Managing Up Is Hard

![Managing Up](managing-up.svg# maxw-50pct center)

???
* The "layers" of management: managing your work, your manager's work, who manages the interface between? Managing "up" is an amazing skill.

# What Works, And Why

---
class: img-right-full

![Process](rawpixel-570911-unsplash.jpg)

# Know Your Company's Processes

- Who does what, when?
- What are the policies, standards, criteria, requirements?
- Legal, Security, Finance, Procurement

???
* Figuring out your company's purchasing process. Will it go to legal, security, finance, procurement? In what order? What are the steps, who does them, what criteria do they use? What requirements are there?

---

# Define The Business Case

- Focus on the problem, not the solution
- Good questions lead to good answers
- Success criteria
- ROI analysis

???
* Clearly defining the business problem. Stating success criteria.
* ROI analysis. Add 40% salary burden for heads. ROI of problem, not just the solution.

### Sell The Problem, Not The Solution

If the problem isn't worth fixing, the solution isn't worth having.

???
* Selling the problem, not the solution/product

---
class: img-right-full

# Make Your Manager Look Good

You're _selling_ several things you might not realize:

* The business problem
* The need to do the evaluation
* The outcomes
* A promotion for your manager

???
* Making your manager look good. You're selling a promotion.
* There's really two steps: selling the need to even do the eval, and then doing the eval and selling the outcomes.
* Sell the problem, sell the project to eval, sell the outcome.

---

# State a Clear Value Proposition

- The solution must: make money, save money, create compliance
- Tie the outcomes to specific, top-level business goals
- Ideally, demonstrate value across business units
- Demonstrate how value changes over time

???
* Value proposition. Must save money, make money, or help with compliance
* Tie to specific, well defined, tangible business priorities.
* OKRs, company goals, statement of strategy. Big picture thinking.
* Can it kill several birds with one stone? e.g. a sales tool can help the marketing team too. Is it something new, or a replacement of something existing?
* Is it solving a problem now, in the future, or both? How will that change over time? If we're fixing a problem today that's worth $10k today but $200k tomorrow, $20k is justified

# Research Alternatives

- Lay out clear, fair, business-focused criteria
- Show how you choose and evaluate alternatives
- Structure your communications carefully
- Work breadth-first, not depth-first
- Articulate outcomes simply and clearly

???
* Researching alternatives and showing thoughtfulness
	* Clear, high-level, business-focused set of criteria, fair
	* How you chose the candidates, how you evaluated them. Literally complete the sentence "I identified alternatives by ..."
	* Structure and process communicates your diligence; data doesn't
	* Breadth-first-search, not depth-first. Crucial to avoid missing options, or spending too much money or time on an option than it deserves.
	* Articulate which alternatives will work, why, or why not.

# Recruit Advocates

- Find internal and/or external advocates
- Find relevant case studies or success stories
- Find and check references

???
* Get others to advocate for you
* Checking references. Just like when you hire, go off-list and find the right references with a similar use case and needs.
* Tie these back to your specific value props

---

# Complete a Proof-Of-Concept

Before you begin...

- Establish success criteria
- Get required review and signoff
- Get preliminary budget approval

???
* Run a POC or trial.
* Have a defined success criteria first!
* Get security, legal, budget review first
* Document everything that can help make the case. Did you solve a problem in the PoC? Don't miss documenting that and telegraphing it as you go.

--

As you go...

- Document your findings
- Tie them back to establish proof of success
- Pre-communicate preliminary findings

# Make Sales People Earn Their Commission

If you're purchasing a solution, leverage the sales rep.

- Their job is to figure out and run your process for you
- They should project-manage you
- A good sales rep is optimistic but skeptical
- A bad sales rep is a career hazard

???

* (If it's purchased) Make the salespeople work for you. Their job is to run your process, make the case in a compelling way, and position and frame the alternatives in a way that makes a clear decision possible.  If your sales rep isn't doing what-if thinking, they're wasting your time as well as their own, and setting you up to look bad.

### Bring Advocates Onsite

Set up onsite meetings for advocates, references, and sales reps.

???
* Bring advocates, especially vendors / sales people, onsite and in person.
* You and they will get much more done and learn much more.

---
class: img-right-full

# Make A Final Presentation

A compelling presentation is specific, quantitative, and walks through:

- Executive summary of findings and recommendation
- Business need / problem
- Return on investment
- What and how you evaluated
- Findings
- Outcome and "therefore I recommend"

???
* Make a final presentation that walks thru: business need, what you'll recommend, ROI of problem, what and how we evaluated, what we found, did it meet our success criteria or not, ROI, therefore I recommend; be specific and quantitative.

![Risks](michael-shannon-574345-unsplash.jpg)

# Focus On Eliminating Risks

* Don't fall into the "happy ears" trap
* Search for reasons this _won't_ work
* Address risks and problems ASAP

???
* Above all, approaching it as elimination of risks, figuring out "what could doom this whole thing" and addressing that early. Ask the hard questions, bring up the elephant in the room, ask "why wouldn't this work" and "what's the objection to that."

# What Doesn't Work, And Why Not

---
class: img-right-full, compact

![Image](unsplash-photos-9KatMVAS-Yc.jpg)

# Mistake: Showing All The Work

* Detail doesn't earn credibility, it weakens it
* Show evidence of work, not the work itself
* Focus on results, not activity
* Use the [Minto Pyramid Principle](http://tomtunguz.com/the-biggest-professional-challenge-of-my-career-communication/)
* Make your _thought process_
  [auditable](http://tomtunguz.com/decision-making-auditing/)

???
* Showing all of your work.
* Credibility isn't earned through myopia, it's harmed. Looks like you're trying
  to impress through activity, instead of results.
* Show evidence that you did the work, but not the work itself.
* Example: name a trig identity, people will assume you know algebra.
* Follow the pyramid principle, it's for presenting too; organize the major ideas ina way that poitns to conclusions, support them with minor ideas.
* Your manager isn't going to audit your work, they're going to audit your thinking process.

# Mistake: Unnecessary Benefits

- Praising a solution in search of a problem shows bias
- Focus on the business problem, not the product/solution

???

* Don't focus on benefits the business doesn't need. It signals that you had a bias towards the product, not the business's problem.

---
class: img-right-full, fit-h1

![Image](unsplash-photos-Pvf-YaxTq7I.jpg)

# Mistake: Appealing To Intangibles

- Don't pseudo-quantify benefits like morale or culture
- Don't imply ROI where there isn't true ROI
- Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus

???

* Appealing to intangibles like morale or culture in ROI. It casts doubt on your other assertions.

---
class: img-left-full, fit-h1

![Image](unsplash-photos-Pvf-YaxTq7I.jpg)

# Mistake: Appealing To Your Needs

- Focus on the business needs, not your own
- If _you_ appear to be the problem, there's a solution for that!

???
* Appealing to your needs, rather than the business needs. Don't say this is for you / will help you.

---
class: img-right-full, fit-h1

![Image](unsplash-photos-bMgsIepVv_Q.jpg)

# Mistake: Muddying The Waters

- Most decisions fail due to "no decision"
- Many a hard decision never gets made

???
* Muddying the waters. Most things fail to "no decision." If you make it hard for the manager to make a clear decision, no decision is the easiest path.

### Mistake: Unrealistic Optimism

If you don't think about risks, you become a risk

???
* Optimism, failing to think long-term and be realistic about the risks to yourself, your company, your careeer

---

# How Did The PoC Turn Out?

???
* Concluding thoughts: the wrap-up of the opening story
* We were able to get apples-to-apples costs of the old way and the new way
* We found that there wasn't ROI because assumptions were untrue, tech was too expensive, and we'd have to gut the functionality, plus revenue potential wasn't big enough to justify

# Takeaways

- Make "yes" easy

???
* Takeaways:
* Approach the problem to bring a proposal that's easy to "yes"
* You're really selling a promotion to your manager
* Your own career is on the line
* Use the pyramid principle. Show structured thinking that shows you did your work, do not drag others through the work itself.
* Breadth-first, manage risks, pessimistic. Do not run down rabbit holes.
* Business value, high-level, tangible, specific, tie to company priorities.
* Make the sales reps earn their commission. Median commission is 9%. Make them earn it. How do they provide that amount of value?
* If you manage up, your manager will never forget it. If you force your manager to manage you, ditto. You grow by doing your manager's job for them.
