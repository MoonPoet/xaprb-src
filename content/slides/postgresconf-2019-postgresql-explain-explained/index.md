# Who Is This Talk For?

---
class: img-right

# People Who Want To Use Postgres Well

![Airplane](tailfin.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- It’s hard to write good queries.
- EXPLAIN is a key tool to get better at it.
- But EXPLAIN is hard to use, too!

---
class: img-right

# Goal: Just Enough Knowledge

![Wave](wave.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- There are many detailed EXPLAIN how-tos.
- My goal today is “just enough” so you don’t have to study multiple in-depth sources to get started.
- You should be able to use EXPLAIN, but it’s not necessary to be a human query planner.
- I’ll give references where you can study details as you need them.

???
- Too many detailed, low-level sources of info adds to your work. I’m trying to fix that.
- This talk isn’t authoritative or complete. Given an EXPLAIN, I’d like you to be able to figure out what it means.
- You don’t need to be able to correctly predict how the optimizer will plan a query, though.

![Bridge](bridge.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

# There’s Many Ways To Run A Query

The database has many choices:

- Join order
- Join type
- Access type
- Index choice
- Algorithms

Relational databases are supposed to figure out *how* so you can say *what*.
---
class: img-right

![Plan](plan.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

# Plans and the Planner

- Each possible way to run a query is called a plan.
- The planner tries to find the fastest plan.
- EXPLAIN shows the plan it chose.

---
# What Actually Is EXPLAIN?

You EXPLAIN a statement by putting `EXPLAIN` in front of it.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2
WHERE t1.unique1 < 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;
```

This doesn’t run the query, it just plans it and outputs the query plan.

---
class: compact
# An Example EXPLAIN

```
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2
WHERE t1.unique1 < 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;
                                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=230.47..713.98 rows=101 width=488)
   Hash Cond: (t2.unique2 = t1.unique2)
   ->  Seq Scan on tenk2 t2  (cost=0.00..445.00 rows=10000 width=244)
   ->  Hash  (cost=229.20..229.20 rows=101 width=244)
         ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=5.07..229.20 rows=101 width=244)
               Recheck Cond: (unique1 < 100)
               ->  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..5.04 rows=101 width=0)
                     Index Cond: (unique1 < 100)
```

# Variations/Options to EXPLAIN
![Mixer](mixer.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- EXPLAIN has a few different options such as output format and instructions to change how it works.
- The main one you need to know is ANALYZE. This *actually runs* the query.
  - `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM...`
- You can also explain other kinds of statements such as UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
  - If you ANALYZE a statement that changes data, do it in a transaction and roll it back.

# Why Do I Need EXPLAIN?

---
class: img-right
# You’re Not Supposed To Need EXPLAIN

![Ducks](ducks.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- In a perfect world, the database would just magically work and be fast.
- But sometimes queries aren’t fast.
- EXPLAIN helps you figure out what to do.

---
class: img-right
# EXPLAIN Helps You Improve Queries

![Gauge](gauge.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Audit what the planner does
- Find schema/indexing problems
- Dry-run before actually running

---
template: section
# What Does EXPLAIN Output Mean?

---
class: img-right
# EXPLAIN is A Pretty-Printed Plan

![Tree](tree.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- A query plan is composed of execution primitives: fetch rows, sort, filter, join, and so on.
- These are linked together into a tree-like data structure that the database uses to run the query.
- The EXPLAIN output is just a textual version of the plan.
- Key concepts to know: terminology, join types, access types.

```
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2
WHERE t1.unique1 < 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  ...
   ...
   ->  Seq Scan on tenk2 t2  ...
   ->  Hash  ...
         ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  ...
               ...
               ->  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  ...
                     ...
```

???

I’ve removed a lot of the detail. What’s left is the plan operations, what the documentation calls nodes.

Child nodes are indented. Execution goes deepest-first: children before parents. When two nodes are at the same indentation, they’re both inputs to their parent. In joins, outer table is above, inner table is below.

---
class: fullbleed

```
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2
WHERE t1.unique1 < 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=230.47..713.98 rows=101 width=488)
   ...
   ->  Seq Scan on tenk2 t2  (cost=0.00..445.00 rows=10000 width=244)
   ->  Hash  (cost=229.20..229.20 rows=101 width=244)
         ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=5.07..229.20 rows=101 width=244)
               ...
               ->  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..5.04 rows=101 width=0)
                     ...
```

???

- Each node has estimated costs, planner minimizes root
- Parent costs are sum of children
- Cost is ~time, in a more or less arbitrary unit, several kinds
- Cost is a range from pre-output of first row to last row. Note the Hash step does most of its work in startup
- Rows is an estimate of rows returned
- Width is average row width in bytes

Extra lines just show additional information about other operations the node does.

???

- With ANALYZE, you get actual timings and actual rows.
- Timings are in milliseconds, averaged per-loop.

# Join Type: Nested Loop

![Rope](rope.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Scan through the rows in the outer table
- For each row, scan for matching rows in the inner table
- Fast to start, best for small tables
---
class: img-right
# Join Type: Merge Join

![Traffic](merge.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Performs a “zipper” operation over two sorted sets.
- Each input needs to be a) an index scan in order or b) presorted with a Sort
- Good for large tables, but has high startup cost if a sort is required

---
class: img-right
# Join Type: Hash

![Mesh](mesh.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Builds a hash of the inner table
- Scans rows from the outer table and looks them up for a match in the hash
- Only usable for equality conditions
- High startup cost, needs memory, fast execution

---
class: roomy
# Access Types

| Access Type |  Meaning |
|-------------|----------|
| Seq Scan | Sequential scan of all rows (table scan) |
| Index Scan | Scan of some/all rows in an index, lookup rows in the heap *in random order* |
| Index Only Scan | Ditto, but no table lookup |
| Bitmap Index Scan | Fetch row pointers from index, sort by physical location, lookup rows in the heap |

???

- Index Only Scan is huge performance boost
- Bitmap Index Scan has startup cost but avoids random I/O
- Index-Only Scan won’t have Filter. Index Scan with Filter means it’s looking up rows in the heap and then filtering them.

---
template: section
# What Matters Most?

---
class: img-right, compact
# Does It Scale?

![Scale](scale.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

Examine the rows estimates.

- If rows = number of rows in the table, the query will get worse as the table grows.
- If rows is small but, with ANALYZE you see a high “Rows Removed By Filter”, you also have a problem.
  - This is one of the only ways you can tell the difference between a WHERE clause that’s used to narrow the range of index values considered for scanning, versus filtering rows after they’re scanned.

---
class: img-right
# Seq Scan

![Ledger](ledger.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Seq Scan is a full table scan. This is a potential red flag.
- It might mean you need an index to find rows more efficiently.

---
class: img-right
# Index-Only Scan is Excellent

![Architecture](architecture.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Index-only scans are *covering indexes* or *index-covered queries* which is a hugely important query optimization.
- See my indexing talk, [How to Index Your Database](/slides)

---
class: img-right, compact
# Sorting Can Be Expensive

![Berries](berries.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Sorting comes from ORDER BY or operations that need sorted data (merge joins, some GROUP BY, etc...)
- Sorting small amounts of data is fine.
- Sorting large amounts, or sorting by writing data to disk and reading it back (external sort), can be slow.
- Sorting can be avoided with indexes (see my indexing talk) or made faster by giving sort buffers enough memory to avoid spilling to disk.
- Sorting with LIMIT is an anti-pattern unless there’s an index to avoid a Sort operation.

---
class: img-right
# Counting Can Be Slow

![Abacus](abacus.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

A query of the following form can access a lot of rows, even if it outputs only a small number.

```
SELECT COUNT(...) FROM ...
```

---
class: img-right, compact
# The Planner Can Get It Wrong

![Planner](planner.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

Compare the actual row counts to the estimates to see if the planner was making decisions with incorrect data.

If so, then statistics can be inaccurate.

- Usually fix with either ANALYZE or autovacuum.
- Correlated columns can be a problem too, and there’s recent support for this.
- Or empty tables.
- Or dead tuples. VACUUM again.

---
class: img-right
# Failure To Use An Index

![Stairs](stairs.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Is there actually a useful index?
- Are you sure it’s useful?
- Is your query defeating it with a calculation?
- Are you using LIKE? Is collation an issue?
- Are there foreign keys, and the foreign table lacks an index to help lookup the values?
- See my indexing talk for more.
 
---
class: img-right
# Forcing / Hinting

![Plane](plane.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- Postgres doesn’t let you add “hints” or force particular query plans.
- But you can kinda do this by messing with cost parameters or enable/disable particular access types with parameters.
- More information is an exercise for the reader. Be sure you read the PG philosophy on why this isn’t a great idea.
---
class: img-right
# Default Parameters

![Cockpit](cockpit.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- A few default parameters need to be set to appropriate values for your server to make good planning decisions.
- `work_mem` for example.
- See the Postgres performance wiki.

---
class: img-right, compact
# Confusing Stuff

![Giraffe](giraffe.jpg# h-70pct w-90pct ofv)

- “never executed” means what it says.
- LIMIT can cause child nodes to terminate work prior to accumulating the total (max) estimated cost.
- Merge joins can also show confusing plan info with ANALYZE, due to rewinding and rereading data.
- The planner usually chooses to minimize the total (max) cost estimate, but in cases like a single-row subquery in an EXISTS, it’ll choose to minimize the startup cost.
