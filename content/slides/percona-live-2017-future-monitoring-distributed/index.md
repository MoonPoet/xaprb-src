# It’s Harder Than It Looks

???

- We want this. The catch is, it’s hard.
- We spend our time serving the data instead of data serving us.
- Critical turning point: press on, or fall back to surrogates?
- It gets harder before easier.
- Feels like working IN business instead of ON.

# SaaS Changes The Game

???

- From code to platforms and SaaS
- Foolish to BYO, but SaaS = dependency
- Cantrill: production, abstractions, high/low, distributed

---
background-image: url(spiderweb.jpg)
# New Dependencies = New Failures

???

- SaaS world = distributed and dependent
- Compiled in, like library
- Not observable
- SaaS = good, just new failure modes

# Monitoring Is Performance Analytics

???

- We’re not ready.
- Silos = bigger silos
