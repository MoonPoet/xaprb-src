Why is it hard to apply DevOps principles and practices to databases, and how can we get better at it? This talk explores real-life stories that answer these two questions, through the perspectives of teams that have changed the entrenched culture, processes, and tooling---and those who've tried and haven't succeeded. Along the way, we'll cover topics including:

- Current and emerging trends in how we build and manage data tiers
- What the research shows about DevOps, databases, and company performance
- The lenses of role, prestige, and stereotypes through which we see DBAs
- The invisible, uncelebrated work that many DBAs do, and alternatives to that dynamic
- How people become DBAs, and alternative career paths and roles that are emerging
- What happens (both good and bad) when database administration is a dedicated role
- What it takes to change from a DBA-centric culture, to one where database-related competencies and responsibilities are more distributed
- Why some teams succeed in this transformation, but others fail
