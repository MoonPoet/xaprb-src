Presentation programs like Powerpoint are complicated and hard to use. Why? Presenting a slideshow is usually very simple: click to advance a slide. Most of the complication of the program, therefore, is focused on creating the presentation, not presenting it.

But authoring a presentation creates no value---only the talk itself creates value. What if the equation were reversed: presentations were easy to create so you could focus your effort on giving the talk, where all the value is to be found? That's what Remark does, and in this talk Baron will show how it works.
