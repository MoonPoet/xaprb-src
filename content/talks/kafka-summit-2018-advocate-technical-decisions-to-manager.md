description: "In this session I'll share my thoughts about effective ways to manage up, avoid micromanagement, advocate your expertise and ultimately grow your career while earning a place in your manager's mind as an indispensable person who makes their job so much easier."
tldr: "In this talk in the 'Business Case' track at Kafka Summit, I explained why it's hard for technical people to communicate effectively to managers, and how to learn this difficult and valuable skill. I covered what works, what doesn't and why, and how to turn yourself into your manager's most valuable team member by managing up so they don't have to manage down."

As a founder and CTO, one of the biggest surprises I encountered was how different my working relationship became with my former technical peers. A casual opinion about a technical matter, which used to be routine, became very problematic when I acquired status due to my title. And my schedule made it even harder for my team to work with me. I struggled to communicate with them, and they with me, about things that used to be fluid and easy. But in the process I also worked with some people who seemed to navigate and help _me_ navigate this new relationship much more easily.
