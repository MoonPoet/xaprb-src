tldr: "Database indexing can be simple and easy. Everyone needs to know how to work with indexes, because indexing is the most important performance optimization for any database. In this talk I explained indexes in a simple way, without the theory, so that anyone can create and use indexes better. I covered the three purposes of an index, the three ways query plans use indexes, and the top six ways to design better indexes."

Do you know what database indexes are and how they work? Do they seem hard to understand? They don't have to be. The basic principles you need to know are simple and easy to remember.

And developers need to know the basics of indexing: your DBAs can't save you, because discovering you need an index after you deploy a feature is often too little, too late. This talk will give you the fundamentals without theory or lecturing. You’ll learn the three purposes of an index, the three characteristics of how a query plan uses indexes, and how to design indexes that are most likely to be optimal for general-purpose querying, whether or not you know all the queries and shape of the data.
