Do you know what database indexes are and how they work? Do they seem hard to understand? They don't have to be. The basic principles you need to know are simple and easy to remember.

And developers need to know the basics of indexing: your DBAs can't save you, because discovering you need an index after you deploy a feature is often too little, too late. This talk will give you the fundamentals without theory or lecturing.
