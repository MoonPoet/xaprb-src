Google's Go language is now very popular for systems programming. It's efficient and fun to program in Go, and it produces high-performance programs. Go is well suited for working with SQL databases, and has excellent SQL drivers. In this talk Baron will show how to use Go's database/sql package with databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. He'll discuss idiomatic database/sql code, available drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL, and discuss tips and tricks that will save you time and frustration.
