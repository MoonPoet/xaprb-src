abstract: "Do you know what scalability really is? It's a mathematical function that's simple, precise, and useful. REALLY useful. It describes the relationship between system performance and load. In this talk you'll learn the function (the Universal Scalability Law), how it describes and predicts system behavior you see every day, and how to use it in practice. I'll show you how to understand the function, how to capture the data you need to measure your own system's behavior (you probably already have that), and how to analyze the data with the USL. You'll leave this talk knowing exactly what scalability is and what causes non-linear scaling. There are two factors, and you'll start seeing those everywhere, too. As a result, when systems don't scale you'll know what kind of problem to look for, and you'll avoid building bottlenecks into your systems in the first place. Final note: this talk requires zero mathematical skill."

# How Systems Fail Under Load

You’ve seen systems become sluggish under high load.

How can we describe and reason about what’s happening?

Unacceptable workload is not sharply defined, it’s a _gradient_

Cook introduces _error margin_. What’s the _workload margin_?

What if you drift into it?

# The Failure Boundary Is Nonlinear

This region is _highly_ nonlinear and unintuitive. It’s analogous to post-elastic material behavior.

# Capacity

Systems can, and do, function beyond their capacity limits.

Capacity limits are scalability limits.

--

How can we define and reason about system capacity?

Ditto, for scalability?

---
# Queueing Theory

There’s a branch of operations research called queueing theory.

It analyzes what happens to customers when systems get busy.

It’s difficult to apply in “the real world” of capacity & ops.

---
# The Hockey Stick Curve

The “hockey stick” queueing curve is hard to use in practice. And the sharpness
of the “knee” is very nonlinear and hard for humans to intuit.

# Crosstalk Penalty Grows Fast

Coherence (red) grows slowly, but crosstalk (blue) grows rapidly. At saturation, \\(\\kappa\\) is creating nonlinear behavior.

# More About Crosstalk

Q: Isn’t crosstalk just a design flaw?

A: Yes and no. Real-life: consensus, 2-phase commit, NUMA, etc…

Q: Doesn’t it seem odd to assume that crosstalk is a constant?

A: It’s not, the amount of crosstalk-related work is a function of N

# How Do You Measure Parameters?

You can’t measure serialization & crosstalk directly; use regression to estimate them.

# What is Scalability?

The USL is a mathematical definition of scalability.

It’s a function that turns workload into throughput.

It’s formally derived and has real physical meaning.

\\[
X(N) = \frac{\\lambda N}{1+\\sigma(N-1)+\\kappa N(N-1)}
\\]

---
# But What Is Load?

In most circumstances we care about, load is concurrency.

Concurrency is the number of requests in progress.

It’s surprisingly easy to measure: \\( N = \frac{\sum_{}^{}{R}}{T} \\)

Many systems emit it as telemetry:

- MySQL: `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_running'`
- Apache: active worker count

# Four Great Uses Of The USL

# 1. Forecast Workload Failure Boundary

The USL can reveal the workload failure boundary approaching. Use regression to
extract coefficients, then plot; or plot and eyeball to see if you’re
approaching the boundary.

# 1. Forecast Workload Failure Boundary

- By estimating the parameters, you can forecast what you can’t see.
- This means you can “load test” under load you don’t yet experience.
- The USL is a pessimistic model.
--

  - Your systems _should_ scale better than the USL predicts.
  - But _you_ should be even more pessimistic than the USL.

# 2. Characterize Non-Scalability 
Why doesn’t your system scale perfectly?<br>
The USL reveals the amount of serialization & crosstalk.

# 2. Characterize Non-Scalability

Paypal’s NodeJS vs Java benchmarks are a good example!

# 3. How Scalable Should It Be?

The USL is a framework for making systems look really bad.

Many 10+ node MPP databases barely do anything per-node.

Calculate per-node a) clients b) data size c) throughput.

One 18-node database: 4000 QPS ~220 QPS/node, 5ms latency.

---
class: img-300h
# 3. How Scalable Should It Be?

You should always measure databases; don’t simply use architectural
diagrams to intuit whether they will scale.

# 4. See Your Teams As Systems

## “To go fast, go alone. To go far, go together.”

Adrian Colyer wrote a good blog post about teams-as-systems and USL.

The USL isn’t novel in that sense... “I gave my boss two copies of the Mythical
Man-Month so they can read it twice as fast.”

# What Else Can The USL Illuminate?

Open-plan offices: My work takes more work when others are nearby.

Map-Reduce: That’s a whole lotta overhead, but it sure is scalable.

Mutexes: Theoretically just serialize, but those damn OS schedulers.

---
class: center, img-300h
# What’s NOT Scalability?

I commonly see throughput-vs-latency charts. This seems legit till you get systems under high load.

![Not A Function](not-a-function.svg)

class: center, img-300h
# Scalability Isn’t Throughput-vs-Latency

The throughput-vs-latency equation has **two** solutions.

---
class: center, img-300h
# Concurrency-vs-Latency is OK

It’s a simple quadratic per Little’s Law, and is quite useful.

# Conclusions

Scalability is formally definable, and black-box observable.

Scalability is nonlinear; this region is the failure boundary.

Scalability is a function with parameters you can estimate.
