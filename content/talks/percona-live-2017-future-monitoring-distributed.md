description: "Nearly all of today's monitoring tools and products are fundamentally incapable of making the shift to the new world of highly distributed, planetary-scale systems. What will this future need to look like, and how can we begin building for it today?"

The world of technology is undergoing a rapid and permanent shift. We all know that we're moving to the cloud at an accelerating pace, but that's not the real news. The fundamental change that's taking place today is that our applications are far more distributed than they've ever been, in nearly invisible ways. And that's not good, because invisible means unmeasurable. This is how jaw-dropping performance problems hide in plain sight. Nearly all of today's monitoring tools and products are fundamentally incapable of making the shift to this new world of highly distributed, planetary-scale systems. What will this future need to look like, and how can we begin building for it today?
