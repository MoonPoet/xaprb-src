Hugo is a fast, and very powerful, static site generator. I use it for my blog, as well as for fancier things like Markdown-based slideshows. I also use it for practically everything else I can, and every time I have to use a database-backed CMS I cringe and plot to rip it out. In this talk I'll explain the basics of Hugo and how it works.
