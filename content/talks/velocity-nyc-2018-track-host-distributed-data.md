How we leverage distributed data and state is today's key competitive advantage. This track explores the technical challenges and lessons learned in managing distributed state in large-scale applications that reliably process millions of events per second. Learn proven strategies and gain new insights from leading practitioners into how to handle real-time data in streams and events.
