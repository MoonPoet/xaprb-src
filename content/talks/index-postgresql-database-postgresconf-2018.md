Do you know what database indexes are and how they work? Do they seem hard to understand? They don't have to be. The basic principles you need to know are simple and easy to remember.

This talk will give you the fundamentals without theory or lecturing. Youâ€™ll learn the three purposes of an index, the three characteristics of how a query plan uses indexes, and how to design indexes that are most likely to be optimal for general-purpose querying, whether or not you know all the queries and shape of the data.
